"What happened with private servers and gravity? A long time ago I read on internet and some forums that a lot of server will close due to the multiple plaints from gravity, like Talon Ro or Nova Ro to name just a few. They have no license to open a 'pirates servers' but shortly after, I saw a lot of private server announcements and the privates way to play revived. What happened? Gravity lose the lawsuit? There is a legal void? Or just gravity were tired of being an asshol*?",RagnarokOnline
"Recommendations for Third Class Servers? Hello! I haven't played RO in a long time but wanted to start again with a few friends, and I wanted to see if anyone had recommendations. 

I wanted to play a RO server with third classes. I'm generally most comfortable with mid rates, but I'd be happy with any rates from like 30x-1000x (around 100-200x preferred though!!) 

I'd be open to fourth classes as well but wanted to play something with an active PVP base (PVP or WoE), but it seems with fourth classes people don't really play those since it's not properly balanced. 

I live in the US if that helps. Thank you!!",RagnarokOnline
"Will Asgard Legends ever return? Soon following the cataclismic event last year, Asgard Legends halted operations alongside other private servers.

It had a singular version of RO that was neither pre- nor post- renewal, but somehow had the best features of both, like armor and stat scaling from pre- and classes from post-.

Also, it expanded the classes without requiring rebirth, which I have always disliked.

I would like to know if  anyone knows if it will ever return (not even the discord has, IFAIK) or if there is something similar to it? Thank you all.",RagnarokOnline
"Oh a patch or oh, a patch? Hey, hoping you have a good day today. I am playing right now in low rate server with a thousand people playing with me. And there is some patches every week with new addition and some balance changes. Last patch they add ep 6.2 which is amatsu and kunlun. I was excited to play because all of the farming spots i know before patch was bombarded with other players. And I tried the usual gonryun 1 farming, which is enchanted peach tree grinding. Of course any rogue like me would be super happy to farm with auto steal. But I am not. I am not getting the usual happiness once i sell my loot. It is because of nerfed drop rate and selling prices. Kind of expecting 100k per 30 minutes (of course royal jelly and solid peach) but no. I got 50k per 30 minute run. Which is less profit than 80k punk farming(overcharged) Which also begs the question, are the owners trying to (nerf?) or remove those who bot? Or they are making players(students and workers) give a hard time to grind?",RagnarokOnline

"I want to start a local private server just for myself. I've been playing RO on/off since it first came out 20 years ago. Every year I migrate from one private server to another, and I've noticed that I've never really needed the MM part of it as an MMORPG. I've been playing RO as a lone wolf and I enjoy it. In the past years I enjoyed playing RO just to see how fast and efficient I can be in reaching the endgame. So I've come to an idea, why not just make one just for myself.

I just want to explore the game like I've never before. Where and how do I start in this endeavor? Btw, I'm comfortable in coding, but not an expert. Has anyone else done this? How was your experience?

Here are my few specifics on what I want in my private server:

1. Latest Renewal server and features.
2. The usual Healer and Warper NPCs.
3. A bot friendly server where I can setup my own priest or bard bot slaves.

Thank you for reading.",RagnarokOnline
"Is Elemental Master better than Arch Mage? Got rAthena and been playing around with endgame gear and from my observation Elemental Master is superior to Arch Mage for these reasons

1. Most endgame bosses have mad reduction from all elements except neutral. From my assessment Psychic Wave &gt; Comet Spam via Spell Book by a significant margin. With the right equips PW cd is 2 sec and it hits for 7mil. Comet spam on the other hand hits for 2.2mil per cast. So while damage is similar, EM can run away for 2 seconds where as AM needs to stand still and mash buttons.
2. AP. Elemental Master is largely independent of AP. Wizard on the other hand needs to spam his 4 cannons 50 times every 5 minutes to get a climax on.

But the few 4th class threads I could find all say AM &gt; EM. Is it because I'm missing something or is it because endgame gear is so impossible to get it's not relevant?",RagnarokOnline

"Question with regards to getting 100% drop rate using Bubble Gum and Drop rate increase gears  So basically I've been playing in this server where they have gears that adds a drop rate chance.

Now I have gears that increases the drop rate chance of all items to 58% and I've been also using Bubble Gum which increases the drop rate to 100%

Since the base drop rate of the item I've been farming is 40%, adding an increase of 158% to it should change the drop rate of the item I'm farming to 103.2% (Since 158% of 40% is 63.2 and adding them both results in 103.2%)  
However, not all kills guarantee the drop as sometimes they don't. I've read somewhere in github that you cannot increase the drop rate chance above 90% with using scripts like ITEMBOOST from bubblegum

I'm trying to confirm if that is true, or is there something I'm missing. Thanks a lot in advance!",RagnarokOnline

The 4-th class and it's respective jobs been around for a couple years by now, but there's still no in-depth info written by anyone on this. I've upgraded to it recently, on three different chars and job routes, but still extremely confused on where to put the points as to not ruin my characters, I'm nearing maximum levels on all three, but still haven't spend a single Trait point on anything thus far, because I'm afraid of ruining things royally, I feel like I'm going to play Russian roulette WHILE being blindfolded.

"Laggy Mouse Movement on more powerful PC but none on Gaming Laptop. I have laggy Mouse Movement w/ my desktop running a Ryzen 7 7700x and 3080ti. Not Laggy on my laptop w/ a mobile 3070 and less powerful i7 processor (11th gen I think) both 8 core. 

So I experience considerable lag when the skills menu is up and less but still very bad lag when other ui elements are open such as stat point menu, quest journal, etc. I also experience major mouse lag in Pront with all the market signs up.

I thought this was just normal due to the age of the game and being DX7 etc. But recently I was on the road and brought my gaming laptop that's not as powerful as my PC.

"How can I go back from Morroc to Prontera without using tickets? I just joined the game last week with my boyfriend and so far, so good. Thing is, is there an ACTUAl way to go from Morroc to Prontera without relying on tickets or money? Just walking or using warps. Some info:

\- I am playing on the 4Game server (Loki). As far as I know, it is Ragnarok Renewal.

\- There is a guard on the Sograt Desert (Continental Guard Quarantine) on the north side that says that he could teleport me to Prontera, but pressing the option does nothing. The map is "" **moc\_fild20""**

My question is due to the fact that is quite difficult to make money, and if you run out of tickets you are literally stuck if you happen to be on Morroc. Any ideas?

"Small ""rant"" over payon stories Hey guys. So I'm going to vent a bit here, hopefully someone will help me see things different or can give me another option
A couple of months ago I was very excited I finally found a server that I liked and had BIG amount of population. (Oath ro) 1 week later it closed lol. I started playing Payon stories since the beta, and I couldn't be more excited because my wife started playing with me (its her first time playing ro).she picked mage, I picked swordsman
Everything was okay until we were done lvling up with migaos. Then I realized lvling  up after that is just getting into parties where you mob stuff into a wall. (Iron fist, seals, etc) As a swords that wasn't a problem first but as someone who likes playing several classes it is a bit frustrating knowing that it doesn't matter if I create a rogue or a blacksmith or whatever. You're either a wizard, archer class, priest or mobber. Monk? Mobber. Bs? Mobber.  Rogue? Mobber. Etc.
As anyone else I play ro for the nostalgia and what I had in mind was lvling up in different places like ice cave, anubis etc. Personally I don't like the feeling that once after migaos all I will do is mob until lvl 99 and that's it. My class's skills doesn't matter and there is really nothing else after that since I'm already 99. (I also found out recently that there isnt trans classes so knowing I was already past half mid way out of nowhere frustrated me too)
I understand that since the server doesn't have warp agents or healers or job changers players will go to the most efficient route. For example trying to get to anubis walking just to try to lvl up wouldn't make any sense compared to getting warped into Anolians or magma. But that's not the experience I was looking for.


For TLDR: In my opinion I don't like the lvling way of the server and I would like to find a server with the same amount of population where you can go lvling anywhere, also that it has transcended jobs.",RagnarokOnline

"Ragnarok Private Server Suggestions? I am a returning Ragnarok player looking for a private server as the title suggest. 

Would prefer the game to remain vanilla as possible where the game would play out the same as the official servers would but I would like few QoL feature changes such as:

- Class change/reset skill features (for trying out builds) 

- Not p2w and allow cashshop items to be dropable or free(to experience p2w/cosmetic items without paying) 

Like to also add I might want to play renewal for content purposes but may be open to other versions such as revo, classic and zero. 

PvP and WoE is not as important as I am focusing on playing with my partner but it would be nice to have.

 Payon Stories - Job bis 2-2 

Alfheim Project - Job 2-2 Trans 

NovaRO - Job 3-2 Exp Rate 25x 

Shinning Moon - Job 4-2 Exp Rate 100x

"Would you guys join a private server like this and do you guys think people would be interested? I'm a player that is looking to get back into RO for nostalgia sake and I am trying to figure out what it is that makes a server worthwhile in investing time in. The biggest issue with different servers in my opinion is

**Official Server**

\- Very P2W, very cash grab

\- Population is basically full of bots

\- Grindy

**Private Servers**

\- Some P2W

\- Population is fragmented because people have their preferred server to play on resulting in underpopulated server

\- Servers get closed down and you lose your progress

\- Corruption, mismanagement, drama

\- Sometimes is too customized that you miss out on the true RO experience

Given all those issues that people most often complain about different RO servers, if there was a server that had these ""features""

\- No cash grab (donations, premium, cash shop, etc)

\- Has minimal customizations (outside of rates boosts)

\- Rate boosts to avoid grindiness

\- Commitment to not close

\- No GMs, no corruption, mismanagement, drama

\- No customizations, just a true RO experience

\- Renewal so that nostalgic players can experience the new content

"What is an outdated mechanic you'd like to be gone from RO? There's many on my mind, but first one that comes to mind is probably monsters being able to break your weapons and equipment in a single hit is a bullshit mechanic.

"2D sprite artists needed for Ragnarok Online reimagining Currently we are a team of 8 working on a multiplayer concept Ragnarok online reimagining. I am one of the c++ developers and founder of the project. It’s being developed in UE5 and we’ve been working on it for ~7 months now. Many features are being fleshed out but we would like to have our own assets. Like Ragnarok online, the characters will be 2D sprites. We aren’t looking for a 1:1. We have outlines ready for what type of art style we are looking for.

This project is not a “remake” of Ragnarok Online. It is a reimagining. There will be no assets taken from Ragnarok online, it is related in concept only. The goal of the project is to modernize and “fix” many of the outdated and predatory aspects of RO and have it have its own name and design. The core feature of the project is that it will have 2d sprites in a 3D word. The logic has already been accomplished for this in our project, and we are getting ready to create our own sprites. We are using assets from the store for the 3D portion, but would like our own of course.

We have a discord server we communicate in that is open to the public but private to team members; when we are ready to show more to the public it will be more fleshed out with details about the game, but everything you need to know about it is in the private section.

"Is RebirthRO still active? I was an active player during the Ancyker coup vs Syphon. I was actually on Ancyker's side, believing that what he did was justified because of how Syphon was wasting the money being made by the server.

Unfortunately, Ancyker banned my main account because he thought I was advertising Syphon's new server. Syphon's revival just retained the login info, so players jumping ship had to start all over and I had thousands of hours worth of grinding on my main account that I did not want to do all over again. So I just lost interest in playing either server.

So, is the rebirth.ro server still around? The website seems to be in lockdown, so I don't know what to make of it. Possibly related to the legal threats by Gravity. The server seems to be delisted now from RMS. But maybe the community and the server is still active. Just want to check in.",RagnarokOnline

I checked google for where they drop, but it led to ratemyserver which seems to be out of date because I went to Payon Dungeon 5 and didn't see any Dokebi (only sohee), I tried pay_fild10 but it also didn't have any Dokebi.

"Best option for lore/quest-including servers? Hello, everyone. I've been an on and off RO player for years, and got the itch back again. Like many, I'm looking for suggestions and comments on choosing a server, and haven't gotten to a conclusion off of previous threads and the pinned section, so I thought I'd ask. Ideally, what I'm looking for is:  


* Up to date character content (Renewal, 4th/expanded jobs etc.);
* Grinding on the more casual side (mid rates, party loot systems etc.), but not absolutely necessary;
* Avoiding P2W;
* Quests/general lore content present (I never went too deep on this aspect of RO, and after some reading, it has really got me interested in digging in-game, so this one is a must).  


Quality of life improvements are always welcome, though @ commands are not necessary. I've played Shining Moon in the past, but it seems there is no interest in recovering questlines. I've been on many official servers as well, but the P2W aspects are just a huge turn off.

From going around the subreddit, I've found mentions of RockRO and MuhRO, which seem fitting, but with little information around them. Has anyone tried these servers? Are there any others you'd recommend?

"RO Improvement Project Test Server is now available Hello, players.

A while back I talked about a pet project where I tried to boost the mechanics behind some forgotten skills and builds for the purpose of having a more fun environment where your favorite build can shine in both pvm and pvp.

This pet project is intended to inspire server owners with some new mechanics that don't fall too far from vanilla Ragnarok, but aim to improve the user experience with more variety and make the user feel like rediscovering this game.

^(BTW if you are a server admin or want to be one, you can copy these mechanics directly, I'd love to play that.)

After some months of work player skills for 2-1 and 2-2 are finally done plus a few more tweaks and can be now tested in a test server, open to the public.

If you wanna know more about these changes and try them head over to discord: [https://discord.com/invite/M6aXbjw6Dq](https://discord.com/invite/M6aXbjw6Dq) any feedback is kindly apreciated!

But remember: this is not a real private server, only a test server. Data can and will be deleted periodically, you also have available several commands to test your builds more in depth.",RagnarokOnline

"Port Ragnarok Online to Nintendo Switch  I mean a direct port of the PC version of the classic Ragnarok Online game. Not a reinvent like they've done with a lot of Ragnarok mobile games.

Make it work with the switch controls and the touch screen exactly as the game is. Clean it up a bit, sure, but don't change anything drastically.

Keep the music, the sprites, the animation and combat styles - all of it.

I'd say the only way RO could, or even should functionally be improved to be more accessible, would be to have it fully voice acted. At that point, it'd just be an unbeatable game IMO.

If Nintendo and Gravity actually sat down and spoke, they could make this work. And it would be absolutely massive for both of them in terms of sales.

I'm sure I'm not alone in being willing to shell out a pretty penny for a custom release Switch dedicated to Ragnarok Online if they do this.

RO is a very old game now, too. I was basically a kid when it came out and now I have a kid of my own who also loves to play RO but doesn't grasp PC gaming yet. I think this aspect of family bonding is also very in line with both Nintendo and Gravity and could be promoted as good way for parents and kids to bond and game together with a game that is really unlike anything else.",RagnarokOnline

"Revo-classic / Zero Servers? I'm looking to play RO again, but not that old grindy ass 1x game that I used to play when I was 12 years old and had so much free time. I'm older now, I don't have more than a couple hours of free time per day for gaming, and I want it to be all fun from the get go. To this end, I'm looking for servers that are:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Not just another classic low rate pre-re clone. I know these are popular, but I have negative interest in these servers. Too boring, I've done it a million times and I don't want any more like this. Nothing against the people who enjoy this, I personally cannot stand it.
2. Revo-classic / zero would be ideal, but the minimum is probably something like Alfheim with the upcoming expanded class rework. I'm already playing there, but the low rates really aren't suitable for me. I don't want to spend 3 hours grinding a card when it's the only 3 hours I can play that day.
3. 10x-50x range (lack of time to grind, I just wanna be casual and have fun) but nothing higher than that preferably. I don't enjoy super intense gear grind at all, even when I do have time for it.
4. If not revo-classic or zero, at least 3rd jobs. Don't care if it's pre-re or renewal mechanics, jRO server would be super fresh actually. I don't want to play any more archer.
5. somewhat populated, if possible. \~100 active players is ok.

I've looked through RMS and played Einherjar, Aspen Grove, Maroll Kingdoms, Talon Tales and a few other servers. The only one I'm still playing mega casually is Alfheim, which is a great server but does not work for me because I feel that my time isn't being rewarded because of the extremely low rates. Yes, I'm casual now, and I like being casual. 

If you have any suggestions of upcoming servers like what I'm looking for, I'd be very much grateful. Don't mind my wording, I don't mean to come off offensive. I'm just mentally exhausted from irl. Grindy ass games are more than fine, I just don't have the time, energy or inclination to play them anymore.",RagnarokOnline

"Homunculus and AI I'm playing RO again after being so many years away from this game. I know that AFK leveling no longer works for alchemists, but the AI is the big problem here... it doesn't work at all

The private server I'm playing is running episode 18.1 - Direction of Prayer with the 4th class. The AI is not configurable anymore? even /hoai doesn't seem to do anything...
I tried using the AzzyAI and setting the config to make the homunculus ignore all monsters so I could up in maps that he can't survive but it doesn't work he keeps attacking all monsters haha, the only thing that works is right-click on the homunculus and selecting the option to make him wait, so he goes on passive mode but as soon as I use a fly wing or go through a portal that is reset... this is the worst experience ever

What feature I remember most was that it used an alternative emulation method that wasn't rAthena or the other one based, which meant that gameplay was really smooth and more precise.

I looked on a few sites, but no server rings any bells and also seems like a few servers died since last year.

"Help getting an idea of the different Ragnarok mobile games Hello,  
I know the various mobile games have been discussed before, both here and on other subreddits, but I wanted to spend some time on one and can't get ahold of the differences and decide which one is worth exploring.

(I know the original RO on a private server is the best choice but I wanted to try the mobile ones)

So here is the summary of what I understand about the current situation,  
I'm particularly interested in the differences between the first 3 games on the list.  


**Ragnarok M: Eternal Love**  
Mobile only  
This is the game that has been around the most. It's considered the best of the bunch (?) and it's the most popular. The gameplay looks really similar to Origin.

**Ragnarok Origin:**  
Mobile only  
Relatively new (1 year?) and gameplay is similar to ROM: Eternal Love. Some activity on the official Discord, it looks alive.

**Ragnarok V Returns:**  
Mobile and PC  
It looks like the gameplay is a mix of the original RO + Eternal Love/Origins but I've only read bad things about it. The Discord looks kinda dead

**Ragnarok Begins:**  
Mobile and PC  
Side-scrolling gameplay. Can't understand if it's dead on arrival or the community is scattered around

**Ragnarok Arena:**  
Mobile only  
It's a strategy game and recently released. I'll try this one out for the different gameplay.  


Can anyone help me get my head around these games?  
V Returns looked fun and I like the fact that it has a PC client, but googling around it seems that people recommend Eternal Love or Origin.  


I'm not looking to be competitive or anything, so P2W will not be an issue.  
I'm just trying to scratch the RO itch and I'll probably stop playing after a month :)",RagnarokOnline
"[Pre-Renewal]What Class to Play? Hi guys, I know this is an age old question and as an older RO player, I should know about this.

Renewal kind of makes most classes viable but pre-renewal is a different kind of animal.

My goal is mostly to PVM/Farm/Roam but would like to be useful in MVP parties as part of my end game.

I am contemplating between Lord Knight, Assassin Cross and Sniper.  I prefer to play with some Agi.  Even if I play a Vit/Str LK, I would still probably put 50 or 60 agi.  My snipers usually have auto-blitz and my Assassin Cross probably will either be hybrid sidewinder or Soul Destroyer.

Just wanted to know what the meta is from years ago, I do know that LK seemed a bit underpowered, or maybe I was wrong.

Please, I would like to hear your opinions/suggestions/advice.

Thank you.",RagnarokOnline

"Any mid rate Pre-renewal servers with a healthy player base (around 500 or more) going? I'm returning to RO after 8 years and I'd like to play on a relatively lively pe-renewal server if there are any left. 

I heard of the unfortunate law suit. 

Most of the servers on RMS are not as lively + if we add the fact that half of the population are probably vendors, it gets even sadder. 

I shy away from high rates due to the PK/RP, but if there are any without those that are also Pre-renewal, I'd be open to that as well. 

Thanks!",RagnarokOnline
"how to play on Linux So I recently had to wipe my HD and since I didn't wanna pay $99 for a window license, I installed Linux into my PC but I can't seem to play RO thru the official server.

I tried using Lutris to play but the version they have for RO is outdated and doesn't work.

Is there some way to work around it or is there a P.server that allows for RO? I would like to play the official server but I'm at the point where I'll play a P.server for the first time in.. ever if it means playing RO",RagnarokOnline

"With oathRO nuked, which server feels the most like the 2002-2008 original game? (No ads pls!) Returning player here. Did normally RO since I was 13, which is 17 years ago. Came back for the nostalgia and found oathRO had a super friendly community and no bots. 

Now with oathRO gone, which other original low rate server can offer the same?

"OathRO Hibernates It survives.

Dastgir managed to save it. Oathkeeper in his attempt at erasing everything has failed.

All the player data is gone, but the game -- the scripts, the maps, they are all still here in tact.

For now, it will rest in hibernation for a while. Dastgir and I need to consider who shall adopt it and give it a new home, or if we want to try and take it up ourselves (I'm weary of this; it's a lot of responsibility).
But Dastgir bought it back from the flat-line and now it's resting, waiting for the day where players will take residence in the streets of ""New Old Payon"", for first classes to bop all manner of porings in the Poring Dig Site dungeon, for people to farm for faction points in Payon Undertombs, and for elite parties to brave the horror of the Muspelheim dungeon once again.

Thank you everyone both here, in the server discord, other server owners and people on RMS that has shown us support and has sent condolences over the situation. I'm relieved that 14 months of my passion, as well as the hard work of the rest of the staff will still manage to live on in some form, hopefully that will be in the near future.

"Building support for jro I think the issue is really apparent. A lot of people don’t want to play on iro (because it’s terrible), and private servers are too unreliable (like with the oath situation). I’ve been playing on jro with my JP friend, and it’s been insanely fun. With a good vpn it’s not laggy, and it’s actually an active server. 

I was thinking that maybe support for playing on the jro servers should be built. Maybe some ways to translate the game, if possible. Maybe someone can look into making a service where a person can pay someone living in jp (because it is p2p). It’s hard, but I think it would be a good investment. I’m relatively new to ro and not that experienced, but I think it’d be a more worthwhile project.",RagnarokOnline
"Creating a solo ironman challenge for an offline renewal server. It's your own offline server at home. You can tweak the xp and drop rates and make custom changes.

Some challenges I could think of:

* Custom death penalty (pick one).
   * Drop all items.
   * Reset level to 1 but keep all items.
   * Reset level to 1, drop all items but keep items in storage.
   * Start a new account with fresh storage.
   * ""Nuzlocke"". Reset to level 1 but keep all items. You have to change to a random job that you've never used before. Once you've gone through all possible jobs, you have to start from fresh.
* Warp Portal can only be cast in town. You can use Warp Portal to start hunting and you can warp into a dungeon but you have to walk home. Warp Portal becomes a Novice skill.
   * You can still use Fly Wing as normal, but maybe there is a limit to how many you can carry at a time.
   * Teleport becomes a blink skill with relatively long cooldown.
   * You can't use @.go. Butter Fly Wing and Malang SP Can are non-usable. There are no Call of Guardian and other similar skills.
   * There are no Kafra Card, Token of Siegfried, Kaizel.
* ""Level scaling"". You get 100% drop rate penalty for monsters 30 levels below you, no penalty before that. There will be npc that can lower your base level and roll you back to your previous level. There will be a toggle skill that reduce xp rate by 100%, so you don't have to worry about out leveling the monsters when you just want to farm items.
* You can't use alts. You can play duo but only if it's with your husband/wife/bf/gf/dog/hamster. You can't play with your mum.
* There's no way to obtain cash shop items, except maybe shadow gears are dropped or can be crafted since they typically don't cannibalize normal gears and use different slots. What do you think? Which items, cash shop and normal, will you ban from the challenge?

Custom changes:

* Multiclass with increased job level cap.
* You can reset stats and skills in town.
* All non-MVP monsters instantly respawn.
   * Increase (e.g. double) the spawn rate of normal monsters in every map or certain maps.
* All MVPs need to be manually spawned like in Bio 5.
   * Add cooldown to Summon Slaves.
   * MVPs don't use Teleport when rude attacked but cast other skill instead. What do you recommend? E.g. Snap, Death's Grasp, Recovery Conversion, Earthquake/Max Pain with noticeable cast time, etc. Different MVPs can have different anti-rude attack skills.
* Instances have no cooldown. Or they become normal dungeons.
* Increase regeneration after sitting for a while, so you only have to sit, at most, 30 seconds.

The goals:

* Reach max base and job level on every class (or just once if it's Nuzlocke challenge).
* Collect every card until you can see every card in your storage, so cards that you've socketed to gears don't count. You will have multiple storages. There is no Old Card Album.

"Old player looking for private server recommendations Hey eveyrone. I've been away from RO for like 10-12 years now and I'm looking for servers but I can't seem to find any that fits my expectations. 

I used to play a lot in Earthbound-RO back in 2007-8, it was a 255/120 server with like x150 rates iirc. It had a decent healthy population and WoEs were super fun. It also had a decently stable economy, MvP cards were somewhat rare and expensive and having them made you feel OP. Of course it had donation items and the sort but they were not super OP or flashy and they generally fitted the game well enough.

The server went to hell after they added third jobs and lost a huge chunk of population, so I moved on to Dreamer-RO. It was ok but not the same. Too many OP donation items, custom item quests and they eventually added third jobs and ruined it for me. I liked it simple. I gave it a couple of months but eventually I quitted RO for good.

I've been trying a lot of servers recently, both mid and high rate, and they all feel very dead. Even if there's a high player count, everyone's afk or autotrading. I ask stuff in global chat and nobody ever answers.

Is this just the current state of the game, or are the good servers hiding from Gravity and delisted from RMS?",RagnarokOnline

"To every EuphRO players Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

This message is intended to anyone who played on EuphRO, a private server that was quite popular back in 2006. It got unexpectedly wiped, and it was a sad moment for a lot of players.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to let you know that I created [https://euphro-museum.com/](https://euphro-museum.com/), a website that allows you to see your old character, guild, items, and much more.

I also plan to re-open EuphRO for 1 week, for nostalgia sake. All the info are on the website. If you still have access to the email you registered with, you will receive an email within a few days with the instructions to connect to the server.

&amp;#x200B;

We also have a discord, the link is on the website!

&amp;#x200B;

I hope it doesn't break the subreddit rules. Since it's a very old private server that I want to re-open for just 1 week, I'm hoping it won't count as advertisment.",RagnarokOnline

"I miss Ragnarok Online but... I've started playing on euro server back in 2003.

I've played mostly on the official server with a pause from time to time in Talonro

Why ? because after 2010 everything changed.

[Euro-ro.net](https://Euro-ro.net) was the last official server which didn't have a P2W style or I must say a gambling addict routine.

What I mean is the cash shop. As a old eu play I wasn't used to it until we had to move from [euro-ro.net](https://euro-ro.net) to the french server handled by gravity.

Old euro server refused micro transactions with f2p but only sold hats for money

Gotta say that I liked the old way. Playing ragnarok nowdays either via donations or cash shop is just too expensive for those who wanna be more than a casual player.

the worst being those random boxes.

Why can't none open a true server? rather than a money milking machine?

It was in 2D and I think the acronym ""RO"" was inside the name. There was only a few stages, in the first one you could fight a giant Poring as the boss, and for the second stage, the boss was massive Hornet.

No messages on the forums, no logging on, nothing and eventually the guild fell apart bc without the guild leader we couldn't change anything.

I don't remember the guild leaders name but I've always wondered what happened to him? I always worried that he got hurt or die or something.

Interested in starting Ragnarok So as you can see I'm interested in trying to play Ragnarok Online.About 7 to 9 years ago I played Ragnarok DS and I really enjoyed it! Especially Prontera's theme. However I felt scared about the prospect of an MMORPG. And now I have started playing one other MMORPG (Final Fantasy 14) so I think I might be able to handle it now! But I don't know where to start everything is so confusing. I would like to play it on the go if possible or it would be even better if I could play on my PC but also on a tablet as well. I saw an app in the Google Play Store called Ragnarok Classic and that got me very interested! So I would like to know where should I start? And is it possible to play on the go? Or on the go and PC?

So, I played RO years back, all the way back in like 2010-2012 or something. I decided to give a try back at MMO's including RO. It seems a lot has changed!

The starting area is different too, I don't remember starting on a boat and neither having a rival/friend Lun. Anyways, I went to Hun, which... was no help at all, then talked to the guard next to him (because he interuppted Hun and me so I figured I am supposed to talk to him) did his little collecting quest, got 20 potions and now I'm lost. I have no quest, I have no clue where to go or what to do, don't know where to buy weapons etc. To be honest, it's very confusing for new/returning players since you aren't told clearly what to do or how to do what which was the case all those years back. So, if anyone could please tell me where to go from now, and how to get started that'd be greatly appreciated. I'd like to know;

- Where to set my class
- Where to buy gear and potions

"New Ragnarok Online MYSG server issues I was so hyped when this server was announced. A week into the game I am heavily disappointed by the publisher, Electronics Extreme .

First off, during CBT I can play the game without the use of VPN. So I took my time to level two my characters to level 50 just to get the rewards. During OBT however I was unable to login due to region lock. This happened WITHOUT ANY NOTICE. For the love of the game, I spent $60 for a year of VPN. Not even a week after, the region lock was removed. Again, this happened WITHOUT ANY NOTICE and I cant get back my $60.

For the level up challenge, at first the website did not state anything about the forbidden usage of miracle potions. Since the item is in the game, those who visited the site before the new rule would not know it is not allowed since it is added WITHOUT ANY NOTICE. Who would visit the site everyday? I have spent so much money to buy battle manuals, and hours of time grinding to get my priest to level 90. Those who are high level might understand the time needed to get to this level.

To the players, do think again about spending your money into the game. With all the lags, bots and lack of communication with the players clearly show that they are not ready. The server might just close WITHOUT ANY NOTICE.",RagnarokOnline

"If RO1 were to be remade in full 3d, what should it be like? Since the early days of playing RO1, I've always wanted to see a successor be made in full 3d. It's not that I don't like the isometric gameplay akin to Dungeons &amp; Dragons or that I dislike having eastern styled 2D Sprites.  However, when 3D games took over the market, I constantly thought about what would Ro be like in 3D. Well it never happened and I played a lot of 3d games since then, and none of them have really measured up to Ragnarok online's gameplay. So if ro1 were to be remade full 3d and done right this time, how would it have to be made? These are the ideas I've come up with and I'd like you to either critique them or add your own. Thanks

- western fantasy/anime hybrid theme, with nearly same buildings
- lighting and color scheme would vary from map to map, as in original
- larger Maps? Still use grid-like maps and portals or go open world?
- 3rd person instead of isometric, with free movement
- limit walking speed by class, skills and Buffs
- jumps and rolls should be limited by class and skills
- should still have generic looking anime faces instead of using character customisation tools
- should allow changing skin color(limited, realistic only), different sized eyes and different eye colors
- no skin texture, should be solid colors like anime
- only human race, size of character should be determined by each class
- monster aggression should behave the same
- remove auto attack to immerse player in combat
- allow game pads to be used instead of mouse keyboard
- like in Dark Souls put each hot key skill on a button, allow to cycle with triggers
- get rid of redundant skills
- even without Auto attacking, should limit speed of player animations for attacks, on almost same formula as walking speed is handled
- should still have zooming in and out, but not so much that it gives an unfair advantage
- should we still use fog of War, maybe how it's handled in The Witcher series?
- I think targeting should be limited to acolyte and Mage classes, otherwise melee classes and archers have action-based combat mechanics
- I think for the most part monster sizes were handled well in the original, except for bosses which supposedly were the same size as humans because they had to fit in the one grid, so they should be larger now.
- for the love of God, no Global chat except GM's and town events.",RagnarokOnline

I really think that its supposed to be able to be entered by an entire party, but something is glitched. Anyone else come across this too or know if its a known glitch?",RagnarokOnline

"Returning player from years ago, to ClassicLoki, puzzled by changes and empty lvling areas... I used to play on Loki back in.. I don't know.. 2002-2004ish maybe? 


I started playing back in the days when mobs didn't cast abilities yet and a wizard could pretty easily solo Moonlight Flower using safety wall and storm gust.


It was a time when if one went to the churchyard in Glastheim, they'd find dozens of acolytes and a handful of priests sitting in the middle cross area regenning SP in ""mag parties"". 24/7.


It was a time when two maps south of morroc had hodes in it, and lots of young mages.


It was a time when payon or byalan dungeon had... people in it.


Then they added mob skills, classes like rogue etc., war of emperium... juno... etc.


I don't remember if they'd added transcendent classes yet (to iRO) when I quit, but I think maybe these few little things gives you the gist of where I'm coming from.


Now all the places I remember that I've visited yet (only lvl50-60 so far) are empty, and/or have different mobs slightly.. (and virtually no players).  


But like the Glastheim example.. when I was playing, they added red hunter flies and that significantly reduced the whole acolytes training there thing... but when I just went there today there were no hunter flies or fast mobs an acolyte couldn't run away from. I don't see why it wouldn't still be a big leveling spot for acolytes...



Mind you I'm playing on Classic Loki, but I'm trying to figure out just how 'classic' it really is? To me, classic means early 2000s.. but maybe this 'classic' is referring to some time after I'd long already quit?


Anyway... I guess my question is, does anyone have any idea a good direction to point me for possibly some kind of resources for someone like me, some kind of explanation of what's the same, what's different, etc. about new classic loki compared to Loki during the classic years? And/or resources on where everyone tends to level up and hang out nowadays?",RagnarokOnline

so i'm stuck between dancer and hunter, i don't know how effective dancer is other than dazzler being a aoe and negated with alot of vit. i'm aware that traps are really strong, and can be knocked back with arrow shower.

I'm currently playing in Ragnaclan and I thought about playing WoE as Sniper. Now, I've actually never played a Sniper, so I'm a bit confused about if I should use a SS build or a FA one.

As far as I know, SS builds use 170 DEX, 100 VIT, 184~186 ASPD, and wear BG SET and medals. I have a couple of questions regarding this build. Should I use Glourios Bow? And what kind of arrows should I use? I was told to switch between different status bows and arrows and spam AS, is this correct? Also, I think Snipers are far away from Creators during GvGs, should I use long range reductions nonetheless or it would be better to use fire reductions like Jakk or Leib Olmai?

Now, about the FA build. I know it uses 149 DEX, 100 VIT, 90 INT and 190 ASPD (with AGI song). I've read a lot of opinions about this build. Many say that it is a waste of time, but others say it works great against low VIT jobs. Can this build spam AS as well as FA? If I'm not wrong, FA range is shorter than SS's, I guess in this case long range reductions are the best option. Also, are these gears the proper choice? Yellow Bandana, Sunglasses with Nightmare Card, Pencil in mouth, BG SET with Marc/Noxious/Green Ferus, Valky shield with Horn Card and x2 expert rings with Alligator cards?

2. Is crafting useful here, or noone really needs it besides potions like in 90% of MMO's?

3. From what I've heard, Warpportal is the best option for a new player to go in, since it's a new server, and a progressing one. I have a question about economy them- are the rare items getting bound into characters once you pick them up like in ex. WOW, or you can sell them?

I've been a RO player for quite a while but quit right after the 3rd class implementation which I didn't get to play.
The nostalgic feeling brought me back to NovaRO which I'm enjoying a lot.
 

I made a Geneticist and followed the leveling guide on Nova RO wiki. Was able to get a Vanil to lvl 98 pré evolution and turned into Sera which I'm enjoying playing.


I really liked the style of geneticist. I've had a few creators back then, buuut, I'm struggling to make a list of priority and what to AIM for since EVERYTHING is new to me. I read a LOT of guides, information, builds, items, specially ""Aloe Leaflet's"" guide which I almost memorized it all. 
I just hit lvl 116 after delivering the first Gramps quest from 85 to 115 (only did it once since I got quite some level leveling by my own, specially after I got CRemodeling lvl 4 and CC lvl 3. 
What I like about Geneticist the most is to play together with my Sera, I've set 2 different types of AI, wherever I'm mobbing she helps me Paralyzing Pest's, Anolians and Dragon Tail's while I keep mobbing and killing the quest Monsters. I've had a bit of difficulty to configure it's AI but figured out lately.
 

I was wondering if anyone experienced was able to help me to decide what to aim for in terms of Gear's and Leveling wise. The basic equipment suggested by every guide i read are more expensive than some other items For example: 
Yesterday I bought a Hurricane Fury +4 for 2kk And I've equipped my Skeleton Archer card already.


The guides usually suggests Thanatos Hammer or Doom Slayer but they are far more expensive than Hurricane.
Same thing for the Garment. The suggested ones are more than 20kk.

 
As a New player, I don't have any friends, gear, anything that eases the climbing for me, so I'm begging for a Good Soul to give me something to Aim for in order to Improve.


Currently Stats:
LVL: 116, JOB: 17
Cart Remodeling: 5, Cart Cannon: 5, Cart Boost: 5 (Some Skill points without Use)
My Creator/Alchemist Skills are the same as Aloe Leaflet's S2
My Cart Cannon Damage is around: 6,9 ~ 8,1K;
Stats (Base)
STR: 65
VIT: 35
INT: 105
DEX: 100
AGI and LUK: 1
 

Equips:
Apple of Archer +4;
Welding Mask;
Eden Armor;
Hurricane Furry +4 / Skeleton Archer Card +10% Long Ranged Damage;
Variant Shoes
Eden Garment
Acessory 1: Some Ring i got when got to 3rd
Acessory 2: Nothing.


I was thinking about leveling with Eden until I get PainKiller with SERA, some Fire resistance and finally start mobbing Magma Dungeon 2 to try to make some money.

Thanks in Advance,


TL/DR: Old RO player new to Renewal system, First Class Geneticist Struggling to decide Which Equipments to AIM for as well place to level, tips or anything in order to improve my Geneticist damage and Mobbing/Leveling capability.
 

THANK YOU!",RagnarokOnline
"Possible Return to the Game So after some random chit chat I had online today about some crazy MMO experiences, I had a slight itch to pick back up RO again.  

I used to play on Private Servers (A high and super high rate one) and last thing I remember being added was Satan Morroc (Like 2008 to 2010).  

So have a few quick questions.  

So I been reading up about the whole Pre-Renewal and Renewal thing (Sounds a lot like the Evolution of Combat that happened on RuneScape), and got a few questions about it.  

How harsh exactly are those penalties for drops and expenses?  For the removal on instant casting at 150 DEX, that only applies to specific skills, right?  

I used to play a lot on a Sin X back when I played. Now I feel like going down the path I love more now and going Tank/Bruiser/Fighter. What would you suggest for a good Tanky DPS character (PvP and WoE oriented is something I had my eye on)? Doing a quick skimming and seems like Sura and Royal Guard might fit that bill. Any other suggestions?  

Lastly, looking for a new P Server to play on. Post Renewal with a sizable community and not P2W style on the end game (AKA No crazy insane donation items with ridiculous stats etc). Maybe even one that combines the best of both worlds from pre and post Renewal. ",RagnarokOnline

"EXP Quests? Hi,

I just found leveling extremely difficult, since I am incredibly adapted to renewal's leveling rate. Renewal has (eden of course) and other exp quests and events. I just want to ask if there is possibly some quests or npc that will help me level quickly. I'm not satisfied with the level-up by only killing thing.

"RO restart - knights So just started playing restart (haven't played since classic). I recall most people would go spear Knight with a high SVD build since it's best for mobbing. Now I notice practically every Knight is two hand sword BB.

"Question: Rouge weapon, VVVS Tsurugi+Snake Hat or VVVS Damascus+ pecoHB/indo beret Whats the best combo in your opinion? this is for PvM/PvP type.. (let's assume you can plagiarize Trifecta blow for both choices) verything here is my assumption only (I picked VVVS because its the most affordable weapon you can get for rouge and since we have endow weapon now, you can just pretty much endow element so you'll be more powerful)

Pros/Cons for VVVS tsurugi+Snakehat: 

Cons:

•minus 1 atk speed : dagger

•cant change headgears (because you need double atk)

Pros:

•Higher damage than Damascus

•a lot of leveling/farming sites have medium size monster (tsurgi deals 100% to medium size, 75% to small,large)


Pros/Cons for VVVS Damascus:

Cons:

•lower damage (obviously)

•good only against small monsters (daggers deal 100% to small, 75% to medium,large)

Pros:

•faster atk speed

•can change headgears depending on your play style

"iRO (how is it today?) Hi,

This is one of the best games I've ever experienced in my life. It brings back some great nostalgic memories, and I want to (once again) play it again. I know its popularity and population has decreased immensely, and I don't want to play within a small community. So, I have a few questions in mind. Please answer them with great honesty, I would really appreciate it.

1) How is it in general? Especially today (obviously).
2) What's the current population? (If you can give an exact number, that would be great)
3) Is it still worth playing? Ex. Is the community and environment sufficient for the players. Will it be ""enough"" to enjoy the game properly?
4) Had it been better before? 
5) What aspect does the game provide that makes you want to ""still"" play it (Or not play it anymore)? 
6) These questions pretty much apply to ""iRO"" since I believe it's the most ""global"" RO can reach. the ""i"" means international right? I think. 
7) How many players does RO have back in the day?
8) Is there still a possibility that the RO population increases today? 

- Whatever answer you guys might provide, I'm still going to play it either way. Please give me some more background information. Like, how many bots are there in game, quality of the game, is it easy to find a party, is it still fun, etc.. I know I have a lot of questions, but answering these will be real helpful.

- By the way, what class is good and fun to play atm?

Hi there, RO fans!

I’m a leader of a small team aiming to create a new shiny classic-RO-like game.

Putting it shortly, we want to make it lean and simple. No questing for leveling, no thousands of useless pass-through equips, no nothing that is not: brutal grinding, char customisation, fast PvP, hardcore GvG.

We are at a very beginning, just couple months in, just basic gameplay is done - network, walking, fighting, 1.5 locations, some primitive monster's AI. Here are a couple of recent shots:

https://imgur.com/a/hfel9

And a newbie class ""Adventurer"" model:

https://imgur.com/a/Y7vWl

I’m here to ask you kindly to share your thoughts:
Does it ring your bell? 
How would you like it to be? 
Would you like it to keep very close to the inspirational material or deviate towards newer ideas?
And finally - would you try a new RO inspired game?

Or maybe you would like me to talk about our vision and plans in some concrete aspect? Gladly.

Would very appreciate your feedback, thank you!

"Ragnarok is a nice game, but it died long ago for me - A personal review Years ago, almost a decade and a half, it was fresh. It was something new. It was probably one of the best games back in time.

I, myself, have always been a huge fan of this game. It was my first mmoprg and, except Tera for a few months, Lineage 2 for 1 week and Guild wars 2 for 1 day, the only mmoprg I have tried.

But it was good because nobody knew about it, or mechanics were almost unknown, or every update had something new that changed the way you used to play.

After 2007-2008 it became stagnant. You had two choices from there: keep playing the very same hugel update for years or accept the update that not only changed the way you used to play, but the game itself, making it just another generic game like the rest.

Nowadays nobody risks, nobody has the guts to do something really new to change this situation. Everybody is afraid of feailure and losing money so they just go with what everybody else is doing (then why do it again and split the already small population of this game?). And those who risked, were just temporary excited anime/show/movies fans who wanted to bring their personal hobbies to the game. Sadly, this didn't work.

I'm a developer, I have made contributions, fixes and features to the Hercules emulator (my fav &lt;3). I'm now am an old guy, almost 30 years old, who looks back with nostalgia to this beautiful game who once was all my joy when coming back from high school or college.

I tried to fix this situation, I wanted to bring something new that wouldn't make you feel like you are playing another game. Classes would be the same but their skills would be enhanced so you are not forced to go one build. Status would work a bit different so you are not completelly inmune but neither are disabled 50% of the time. Grinding would be lessened but it would be equally harder to reach the top. Maps, spawns, monsters, everything would be changed slightly so you can feel the need to rediscover this game like it was first launched.

However, while I could work on the system and had it ready, my work schedule didn't let me manage it - and my communicative skills never were the better to find someone who could stay as an admin or get a group of people to make it work. I didn't do it for the money, even I was ready to lose some money. I just wanted it to be self sustainable and nothing more.

Sadly, all these matters died. Let it say it was due to my inhability or my lack of skills in certain areas. I just wanted someone to show up and taking care of everything while I was working on the back. Too much to ask for a stranger.

And now here I am, checking if someone made what I was trying to make so I can have some fun back in this game. Sadly, it's dying out as always.

In the end I always wish someone could take my work and do something with it.

Sorry for my English.

TL;DR: I tried to make a server slightly different so it could be played like it was something new, because I was bored with the current situation. I couldn't make it and now it afflicts me a little.",RagnarokOnline

"Dangers of leveling in high-botted areas. Apparently you could be banned for leveling in these areas as well if you're not careful. I was leveling with a friend who just restarted and made a swordie to level with an aco in wolves. I mobbed about 7 wolves and ended up winging away because I didn't have the SP to magnum break them all. Ended up sitting down, walked away from my computer, and then came back and warped into a prison/dungeon-like area where I couldn't bwing or fly wing out. Looked at the chat, 0 words or anything from a GM. Then got kicked off the servers, now I cannot get back on.

"Fuck iRO, completely incompetent. They permbanned one of my accounts for a single offensive chat room over night.

Had to ticket for unban after I noticed they banned my main accounts for false accusations of ""botting"". Of course, they won't show any proof, and never once contacted me in chat to ask me if I was a bot, they just banned.

After getting unbanned, I stopped bothering to log in and gave the merchant/priest to a friend who still plays once in a while. Neither of us logged in.
Guess what? Checked a few days later since I had a feeling, one of the accounts was banned again.

My guess is they ban whenever some whiny twat warp troll or retard who spams ""bot"" in front of you and then sends in a video.

In short: If you like ruining the game for people screenshot all those ""offensive"" messages and shops that would make a liberal scream REEE, harass people you don't like with ""bot?"", you'll (eventually) get them banned once they get around to it.

"Magnum and sonic Ive always been wondering why they are named magnum break and sonic blow.. They are polar opposites (I know that MB is a 1st job skill and SB is a 2nd but), Chaos(manga) and Loki(manga) uses these skills as if these are their favs. Even Roan(anime) and Iruga(anime) have used these skills a lot too. 

Ive searched the net and there is something that also uses magnum and sonic, yes its Let's Go(tamiya). I guess Lee Myung Jin liked tamiya and used the words as the 2 most used skills by his 2 most important chars. RO is based off on Lee's Manga, so Gravity adapted the skill names.

There's been 15 years of modding, right?

The big ones that I'm having trouble adapting to are:

* left click to move/attack. 
* Right click to change the camera angle, and shift+right click to change the vertical angle.
* Mouse Wheel Up zooms out, mouse wheel down zooms in

Especially since I come from a Moba background and Dungeons and Dragons Online background, I'm used to:

* Right click to move/attack. 
* Holding down the scroll wheel button to move the camera (in any direction, not horizontally when not holding shift and vertically when holding it)
* Mouse wheel up zooms in. mouse wheel down zooms out.

I'm also wondering if there's an ""attack closest target"" button. In League of Legends I ""attack move"" more than I regular move. 

Also is it possible to unlock the camera from your character and scroll around the map? Or at least increase the draw distance so I can see enemies that are farther away. Because I have an archer, and with rank 10 vulture's eye, my attack range is 1 square longer than the draw distance when on the same horizontal or vertical axis as an enemy, which is kinda silly.",RagnarokOnline

Second try, I logged on to an (apparently honest, meaning good statting, gearing, skilling) priest standing in Morroc which got disconnected a few seconds later due to someone elses login on this account (lol), where I am not even sure it was the owner - more probably some other guy randomly getting connected to someone elses account.

"RevoClassic: WoE/Boss Hunt Knight Stat build? I am kinda confused with this one. I am planning to make an SVD Bowling Bash build knight (2hand when leveling, 1h+shield in woe/boss hunt) and I read some post that you should put at least 40 agi to have some decent atkspd for PvM (i use 2hand sword) and WoE/PvP.

Right now, i am confused if i should go full SVD or SVaD. I tried to tweak my stats in a calc and if i go with agi it would end up like this: http://imgur.com/NvKyhcu with 15.1k HP. The atkspd showing is with 1h+shield and it should be **160** (removed the 2hand quicken buff). I got 176 atkspd with 2hand.

"Compilation of Revo-Classic Tips and Builds This is a compilation of tips gathered from me and my brother’s experience on playing pRO Revo-Classic since its CBT. This also includes tips shared to us by our guildmates and friends.

Let’s start with character builds.

Knight is king in terms of farming and leveling due to the cheap cost of ESBs. At the moment. There are two popular builds at the moment, VIT Knight vs AGI Knight. AGI Knights excel in the early leveling phase, as these use less pots due to flee. However, for leveling 75+, the most efficient way of farming is by mobbing. Due to the Renewal Flee mechanics, flee becomes irrelevant when mobbed by 5 or more monsters. As such VIT Knight are preferred.

Hunters’ two most efficient builds are AGI-Falcon and Trapper. Pure AGI-DEX are not as efficient as the other two as DEX does not affect damage as much as it used to in classic. AGI-Falcon build is high AGI, mid DEX, mid LUK (60 total), low INT. Trappers build is high DEX, mid to high INT and mid VIT. Trappers are not limited to just using traps as they still have Arrow Shower to rely on. Both builds level the same way until 65+, DSing Geographers or High Orcs. Word of caution though, Trappers are very expensive to use due to Trap costs. AGI-Falcon would want damage modifiers and plus ATK equips while for Trappers, stat-boosting (DEX and INT) equips are needed.

Blacksmiths also fall to the same dilemma of Knights with VIT vs AGI, but Blacksmiths do not have the HP bonus of Knights. Good thing is that Cart Revolution never misses, but requires practice to be used effectively. When using Cart Revo, it is most efficient to pin mobs to walls on your left side. Hammer Fall + Cart Revo is your best friend for leveling.

Heals in Renewal are “nerfed” as it is now based on your MATK, as such many Priests uses Turn Undead as their main leveling tool. Full Support Priests, except for large organized parties, are typically more of liability at the moment in terms of Support vs EXP benefits due to cheap prices of ESBs.

Wizards are not that much affected in terms of builds. Geographers and High Orcs are your best friends. For higher levels, Wizards require a party to level. There were some people experimenting in Safety Wall builds farming on Magma Dungeon though.

Assassin is the only class that I personally have no experience at the moment. Assassins are pretty much just like AGI Knights without the HP bonus, and is probably the most difficult class to level past 85+ as it is more focused on single target killing.

Other tips:

Always have a max OC/DC Merchant for NPC loots purposes. This is the single best zeny farming advice.

Using Bubblegum is always worth it when solo leveling at the moment due to low cost of Bubblegum, and generally most Kafra Shop items, at the moment.

Snake Hat is a must have for any physical damage dealing classes.

With Renewal mechanics, elemental armors are a necessity for leveling. As such, always put your elemental cards to universal armors to save for your other characters to level.

Very Very Strong elemental weapons are not worth the cost as its bonus damage is added last in damage calculation. Suppose you equips a regular wind axe and deals 1000 damage, a VVS one will only deal 1020.

Lastly, this is just me and my brothers’ view. As a new server, prices quickly fluctuates. As such, invest in assets (valuable cards, etc) rather than saving up your zeny. When the time comes that you actually want to gear up your character, sell these assets (which most likely has risen in value as well).

These are the things on top of my mind at the moment. Will edit the post to add other tips later. Also, feel free to ask questions. I’ll reply as soon as I can.

Also, pardon the formatting as I've done this on my phone. Will edit it once I get to my PC.",RagnarokOnline

I've tried alligators, but I don't have an elemental weapon so they're not the fastest kills with the sin. I'm able to VFW pretty well so was considering leeching in clocks with the wizard.

Since this guy pissed my friend off with his top-tier mental deficiency and abuse of power, and I know a lot of botters in discord and personal friends, I'll spill the beans for you to shame these shameless cucks that call themselves Warp Portal:

iRO does NOT truly ban botters. Yes they do some rare periodic checks...but they literally give 0 shits.
You WILL be banned if you bot. But you will not be hunted relentlessly. 
They do not ban by IP per se. If you don't use a proxy, only logged in accounts will get banned. If you use proxies, it is unlikely your bots will all get banned at once even within the same gm-active map. I mean literally - there's a bot that's been at the same place from the start - it's still there.

They don't check where the loot on botter accounts has went. I know for fact multiple banned botters who did not proxy had logged out accounts that were safe; and this is not a new thing with Re:Start either. 

The reason behind all this? It's a dead game. They want the botters to stay and spend on a 'legit'. They want, no, they NEED the inflated online numbers from the bots - heck if I didn't see those numbers I wouldn't have even logged in to look at the state of the game. This is why they police the forums and auto-ban/delete any posts containing the word bot regardless of the content.

Yes, even discussion of the sheer volume of bots will be deleted and result in a ban!

And remember, friends don't let friends play on iRO! If you need a dose of nostalgia, pservers are better or heck even pRO/thRO.

My SO and I did Marvel together and have done it in the past and noticed a particular trend when spinning Marvel Machine at the same exact time.

We started taking screenshots when we had 5 spins left. You can see the time at the bottom right of the screenshots. For the spins where we didn't get the same item, it's possible the timing was a little off in milliseconds?

"Randomness does NOT mean equal probability After reading over and over the debates as to the meaning of randomness as used by Nexon, I've written this post with the intention of settling the matter conclusively. The community will probably frustrate my intention, but at least I tried :(

TLDR: If Nexon describes something as random but also specifies that it has unequal probability rates, then this is **not** a contradiction. I get that it's not intuitive to everyone, but that's why it's important to read widely.

According to [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/randomness), the three common definitions of randomness are given in this order (boldface is my emphasis): 

1.  The property of all possible outcomes being **equally** **likely** 
2. (*mathematics*) A type of circumstance or event that is **described** **by a** **probability distribution**
3.  A measure of the **lack of** **purpose****,** **logic** **or** **objectivity** of an event 

**Sense 1: Equal likelihood of outcomes**

This sense of randomness is intuitive for many people. In fact, it is the only sense permitted by the definition of (simple) random sampling. [For example](https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/0/A493A524D0C5D1A0CA2571FE007D69E2): ""With simple random sampling, each item in a population has an equal chance of inclusion in the sample.""

This sense of randomness is so intuitive, that [Nexon was pressured](https://www.reddit.com/r/Maplestory/comments/lq9r4j/why_the_kms_players_have_lost_their_shit_and_you/) to include caveats whenever they advertise items with uncertain yet unequal outcomes. 

**Sense 2: Probability distributions**

This sense of randomness is also intuitive for many people, but it's a more technical one. I would argue the definition given by Wiktionary could be a bit more precise, though it captures the essence of why the topic of randomness is confusing. 

Randomness involves uncertainty in individual outcomes, but the distribution of many outcomes can be measured and even programmed. Therefore, describing events as random is misleading *only to the extent that equal likelihood is inferred*. Nexon is now more explicit about the fact that outcomes are determined according to ""set probability rates"" ([e.g., the cube revamp)](https://maplestory.nexon.net/news/80182/v-239-neo-tokyo-patch-notes), and I cannot see any misleading conduct to be admitted in this scenario.

**Sense 3: Apparent lack of logic**

This sense of randomness is a bit more colloquial, but it touches on people's experience of frustration with uncertain outcomes. It can be compared to (and is even contained in) Wiktionary's first definition of [arbitrary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/arbitrary): ""Based on individual discretion or judgment; not based on any objective distinction, perhaps even made at random""

A great in-game example would be the enormous variance encountered in star forcing. [SuckHard's star forcing calculator](https://brendonmay.github.io/starforceCalculator/) can readily demonstrate this. It's also an apt example of how this sense of randomness does not entail equal likelihoods, and the game even tells you what the likelihoods are. 

**Conclusion**

If Nexon describes something as random but also specifies that it has unequal probability rates, then this is **not** a contradiction. I get that it's not intuitive to everyone, but that's why it's important to read widely. The word random is used inconsistently across contexts, and it behooves us not to read unwarranted assumptions into them",Maplestory

"GMS Reboot hasn't been better A year ago I made this post right before kishin nerfs. https://www.reddit.com/r/Maplestory/comments/tblhlk/a_different_perspective_on_2x_drop_coupon_removal/

Here's a quote from my post:
""That said, with the kishin nerfs, instead of more totems or smaller totem durations, I'd like to see complete removal of all spawn enhancers and either server wide spawn enhanced or meso/exp boosted to match the current farming rates.""

I honestly think Nexon really delivered on what I wanted. There's no more spawn enhancers and my exp and meso rates is far better than what it used to be.

Odium, MPE and MP up to Moonbridge makes lvling much easier for less effort. Boss mule meso income is comparable to ~20 hours of totems a week for just ~7 hrs of bossing a week.

Arcane drop rate has gone up significantly since my post a year ago, making it more accessible and easier to replace them, and sf costs have gone down nearly 50% (although I was full 22* before the first reduction, this is still a very welcome change).

While not everything got better, overall, I would say GMS Reboot is in a much better place than it was a year ago.

To all the nay-sayers, please don't jump to conclusions and assume everything is gonna be worse with every change.

If any CMs see this, I love the game and I like the direction it has been going since I came back couple years ago. But more transparency would be appreciated. Even if the reason doesn't sound good at first, we would still like to have a glimpse into how Nexon US makes decisions (such as why Neo Tokyo Meso Shop removal).",Maplestory
"Question about Boss Mule/Time efficiency I'm approaching 275 and am about to work on boss mules. Looking at this chart, I feel like the x18 Boss mule meta is more time efficient and appealing than the x12 everyone seems to be going for (Streamers and what not). If you look at Bosses #11-15, they take approximately twice as long as Bosses 1-10. So maybe 6/7 minutes for 1-10 and an extra 12/14 minutes for 11-15. What I'm asking is: Am I missing something? Why is everyone shooting for 12 GA slime mules? Maybe they just enjoy bossing?

7minx18=126min per week (15.3B)

"Did i deserve to get expelled from my guild? Two days ago my ex guild leader took us on hellux coin run. After he finished killing gollux i hang on the rope and alt tabbed because i was watching a youtube video and assumed that he would be putting on drop gear. While i was alt tabbed, he typed pet loot off which i didnt see. I tab back in and see that there was only cracked gollux equips on the floor and i begin to loot everything with my pet. Ive been getting gollux carries for a month straight now and ALL of these runs i never steal any loot and the carry always tells me i could loot anything i wanted. SO out of habit i looted everything even though  i shouldnt have. The leader kicks me out the guild immediately after. I whisper him my explanation and apologize 3 times because i felt very guilty since this was my first time breaking the rules. I tell him i really want to join the guild again and he accepts and tells me to never do that again. Im happy im back in the guild and apologize again to the guild to whoever needed that cracked gollux equips.

"The Absence of Drop Rate Effects in Filler Events In Recent Filler Events, What has been going on lately with special items and coins not being effected from drop rate% resources. Since Ignition Update, Their has been small repeated pattern with filler events not effected from drop rate% resources (included Coupons, Familiars, Gears, Skills etc). 

First Blake Alphabet, Speculations left to right whether the boxes were or weren't effected from drop rate% resources but even the event was around two half months ago it was one of the not greatest event due to how tedious it was to grind hours for boxes (especially hyper flame boxes) and didn't help that the exchange system would give u something different or exact same letter alphabet u exchange.

Second Clover Shop Guide, Clovers had a very low chance to appear collected and weren't effected from drop rate% resources which made it almost impossible to clover capped thus it made the event without having to purchase clover extensions (whatever it was called) unfair and paywalled advantage.

Third Camelia's Pop-Up Shop, Camelia's Flower Petal Coins are non-effected from drop rate% resources thus this event feels too tiresome and tedious to grind for hour(s)+ to coin capped for the day (300/300) in the upcoming Sunny Sundays it'll be (600/600) and maplers will receive 2x scents from daily missions.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Filler events (in-general events) should not be this gated. I was excited for Camelia's shop after waiting almost two half months only to find out after testing with legion drop rate% coupons (30 mins) that coins aren't effected and grinded for hour(s) and Hour(s) just to be nowhere coin capped for the day.

The Absences of Drop Rate Effects in Filler Events (In-general Events) had kinda made events more harder to do and complete given at certain time. I'm aware and understand that these events besides clover shop guide are from Korea Maplestory and GMS Nexon just copypaste from whatever patches we get from over there. But that shouldn't stop them from atleast try to balance these events to make them somewhat abit easier or atleast fair to be finished with and special event coins and items should be allowed to be effected by drop rate% resources instead the other way around.

only a handful of link skills, (kanna and demon avenger lvl 2 link skills, mercedes lvl 1)

very weak legion from what I can understand

Progressed to Lachelin and started doing the dailies to upgrade the arcane symbol

&amp;#x200B;

Gear:

Faf dagger if I recall 80% prime scrolled from back then, Leg/Leg pots and star forced to 15 I believe

SW Katara as secondary I think it was also primed I forget, Leg/Leg pots and star forced to 15 as well I believe

Emblem is Leg with 21% attk I think so I believe im leaving that alone

CRA Top/bottom/hat (I lucked out and did a random cube and got a -2CDR on the hat but the other stats pots are basically crap, unsure If I should use/sell/reroll.) Top and bottom are either unique/legendary with 2 lines of luk maybe

Sup gollux earring, pendant, ring, and 3 black water rings with 21luk + item drop pots

Tyrant glove, belt, cape and shoes with all decent pots either unique/leg

Garbage shoulder 

I think my range without buffs is around 3-3.9mill

Flames are basically new to me and can assume I have no good ones.

Currently have 12Bil mesos lying around and maybe can get a bit more through selling stuff I had laying around.

How do I best progress at this point and what gear should I replace first/upgrade? At this point I need to learn the mechanics again but killing hard gollux is still difficult for me. Thanks in advance!

* initial 2 week
   * Ticket (Title: Banned)
      *  I dont know why but my game D/c'ed while I was afk and when cause I was googling how to do hungry muto and I got banned when I logged in till August 12 Ive been randomly d/cing and it has been telling me to relog but I thought it was just me lagging. I have never hacked this game before ever. the only programs I have on typically are league,chrome and spotify.   

   * Response
      * Unfortunately, after reviewing the account, we're seeing that the violations found on this account were enough to warrant a temporary restriction of access. Specifically speaking, the suspension was handed down after applications enabling macro usage were detected active and in use at the time the access restriction was executed.This suspension will remain in place until it's run its course.
   * Ticket 2 (Title: Re Banned)
      *  I have been getting d.c'ed ever since i started playing again about a month ago ""for a hacking reason"" and i listed all the programs I had open at the time so I don't know why I would get banned. I was legit afk in town and not even tabbed into my maple story screen I don't know how, I would be considered ""macroing"" . the only program that i had in the background that i might think of triggering that would be the logitech software to rebind some of my keys so theyre easier to hit on my mouse. if you're going to deny my appeal at least tell me what is causing my dc/ban. 
   * Response
      * Regarding your request for the name of program found or more information, we will not be sharing that information with you on the grounds that doing so involves discussing proprietary tools and information.
   * Ticket 3 (Title: RE RE banned)
      *  Like i said in a previous post i dont have any of those programs installed and when i was banned i was literally alt tabbed. looking at muto guides. so i dont know what would be triggering the ban. attached are all the programs run on my computer. im like 99% sure you cant even macro unless you have the maple client pulled up either so unless it was detecting me using logitech software during my league game/browsing chrome i dont know what it was. and am 100% sure i got falsely banned 
      * Was Elevated
      *  so basically what you're saying is I cant play till school starts and this ""escalate"" is just to get me to wait ok fantastic...

      * Unfortunately, after reviewing the account, we're seeing that the violations found on this account were enough to warrant a temporary restriction of access. Specifically speaking, the suspension was handed down after confirmed macro tool usage was detected on this account.
* Perma Ban
   * Ticket (Title: Banned again for ""Botting"")
      *  I'm not sure what happened again or what's triggering my auto ban but, several months ago I got banned for ""using 3rd party software while I was afk"" I thought I had gotten banned because it was a false negative kind of thing because I was having internet issues at the time. I asked what could be triggering it at the time and no one would tell me. so I took the ban facing down. I took necessary precautions and uninstalled anything that I thought would trigger the hack shield. things such as Python, CSS complier &lt;- I'm a computer science major so I had this stuff on my computer, but I have since changed majors so I didn't need them anymore. and when i come back on today I got a perma banned message saying I was hacking again when I literally have nothing on my computer that can even be considered a macro. my typical routine is log on do bosses and log off after collecting monster exploration rewards and maybe talk to a few people while im on. but 70% of the time im idle on maple story. I had just started leveling yeti yesterday and I legit dont understand why im getting punished and you guys wont tell me either

"My account was hacked, Nexon won't delete the account. In a limbo. I wanted to play Maplestory after seeing some streamers play it. It was so nostalgic.

But I found out that my account was banned from the client and I asked the support. Turns out someone stole my account and used hacks until it got placed under an active ban. The support told me they cannot suspend the ban because of this reason.

I felt sad because that account had good memories but I decided to permanently delete it because what's the use right? Plus, I really don't want that once compromised account to be around, technically ""active"" since I can still login just can't play games.

BUT they told me they cannot delete it because it's under an active ban.

No matter how many times I explain that it wasn't me and was hacked and want it to delete the account, it's just copy and paste response.

What do I do?

tl;dr Nexon placed my old account under a ban that they refuse to remove and also refuses to permanently delete the account because of it.",Maplestory
"Reminder that the familiar system is still horrendous for reboot # Background

Familiars are key to progressing your account. From item drop rate, to healing, to boss damage and IED, they help a LOT in bossing.  
Just to put things into perspective, most people see a +15% final dmg increase from liberating a genesis weapon.  
A full set of +100% boss damage from familiars can give you (depending on class and setup) around 10-20% final damage increase.   
With them being so good, anyone after their mid game basically needs them for bossing, since you are in such a disadvantage compared to others if you don't have them.  
Grinding is an integral part to an MMO. People want to feel rewarded for time they put in (that is why things like lvl up exists). But grinding for familiars can feel very bad, and here is why. 

# The issue(s)

* **Familiars don't drop in grandis**  
So, if you've reached 260, and want to get better exp rates at grandis. You better hold your horses, cause unless you got great familiars (which is highly unlikely), the best course of action for you is to stay in limina.   
This gets increasingly worse on higher levels. You still need to farm in limina, while getting abysmal exp rates (and lower meso rates, because your lvl is much higher than limina mobs), just for the familiars. This is not a theoretical, people above 275 still grind in limina to get familiars, or make mules to farm familiars.
* **There is no pity system**  
You can grind for dozens of hours, open your familiars, and not get anything. You still get node stones and mesos, but your familiar situation can (and most likely) will stay the same.  


# Possible Solutions

* **Introduce familiar cards to grandis mobs**  
Add familiar cards to the drop table of grandis (Sacred Force) areas.  
It will HIGHLY decrease the amount of frustration from end-late game players, since you are now not punished for leveling, and can grind wherever you please.  
This is likely not a huge task for developers to add to the game, do the same as you did for the arcane river mobs.  

* **Add red familiar cards to reboot**  
If you are unfamiliar (pun unintended) with red familiar cards, they are essentially like cubes, but for familiars. You reroll your existing 2 lines with a different, random set of 2 lines.  
It can be introduced in the form of buying them for meso (which would be fitting for reboot, since cubes are very alike), or from Reward Points (which are currently very underutilized)  
[This system already exists in regular worlds of GMS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2UdtgSl5lE), so implementing this should be a swift task and the easiest solution by far.  


This issue was acknowledged by our CMs before (if anyone has the link for it that'd be lovely), and they said they will pass it on.   
A few months go by every time people bring this issue up again, yet nothing gets done (or even gets any official comment from Nexon - the farthest they have gone is for CMs to acknowledge the issue a couple of times and said they will pass it on)  
We can only try to keep bringing this issue up, and if there is enough of an uproar, they might eventually hear us and do something about it.",Maplestory

"LF Members for Guild Neko and Friends! Hello!

So I must admit first and foremost, I used to play way back before the Big Bang update! I came to Maplestory around when Aran was first introduced, as Aran was my first class I've ever played!

I played Maple off and on, getting really into it for a couple of months and then burning out my interest for another couple of months back and forth lol. 

I didn't even get a character to 200 until up to two years ago. Now with every level 200 I get to I get exhausted with continuing. 

Though I think the major aspect that keeps me from achieving these goals is doing things by myself. I think it's a lot more fun to do stuff as a group and such! So I and my two friends made a guild to open up to people! We were thinking once we get a guild going, we could start a small discord for it.

Only problem I see is having terrible anxiety, but I really want this lol. I want to reach out and make new friends through my guild. 

So feel free to join! My guild is Neko in Elysium! Anyone can join! It's not much, but I want to build it up! And I know Elysium is rather dead but hey, we can make it more interactive! :\^)

So if you join, thank you! I hope we get to talk more!

"Boss EXP works on Arcane Stones Boss EXP works on the Arcane Stones you get from 5th job. So if you didn't fill up your slots with boss accessories you can do it while also getting more exp for it. 

This is especially useful for GMS since bosses give an absurd amount of EXP.

Example : 

CHT: 84,733,200 EXP

Pink Bean: 62,900,000 EXP + 33,000,000 from statues (3 M for outer statues, 3.5 M for inner statues, 20 M for middle statue) = 95,900,000 EXP

Arkarium: 50,000,000 EXP, good to test iframe out on character and drops Mechanator for boss set effect.

Ranmaru: 90,000,000 EXP

Some others that are not that good but drop useful equipment

Von Leon: 5,000,000 EXP

Hilla: 5,000,000 EXP

Magnus: 5,300,000 EXP

"Fastest average lvl 140 Iv been pushing my legion trying to get to 6-8k, and working on a levelling guide as most are not great.

"If you're currently doing NWill/HWill in a party, and are planning on doing HWill solo in the future, consider practicing for it NOW **TL;DR HWill solo is mechanically much more difficult than HWill in a party, mainly because P3 moonlight generation is extremely scarce. Practice dodging EVERYTHING during your chill party runs, so that it'll be easier when it's time for your cracked solo achievement.** 

I made this post because these are a few things I wished I knew when I first started attempting HWill solo. 

It's you, some time ago. Fresh 250, 25k stat, ready for NWill but you've never done it before. Luckily someone was nice enough to teach you the basic mechanics of all the tests, and how to survive a full run in a party. Remember how overwhelming the boss looked when you first started? ""Don't worry about the chip damage"" and suddenly the boss seemed so much more manageable. A few runs later, you're solid. You've learned the tests, you know the one-shots, you know what kills you. You're the guy with 8-10 lives at the end of your runs. 

Fast forward a few months and maybe some lucky starforce events, you have the damage, you are ready for your solo achievement. You go in. Webs cover the screen, and in about 4 minutes and you lose all of your lives with 0 counterplay. What happened?

As you know, during P3, everyone needs to be clearing webs, so that the screen doesn't get covered. With 6 people generating moonlight, it doesn't matter as much if your moonlight generation is slower. If you're the only one generating moonlight however, you need absolutely every sliver of moonlight.  If you are going for solo, you cannot ignore the chip damage anymore. Which brings us to the title: why not start practicing now? You're already doing weekly HWill. The chip damage mechanics do not change throughout all 3 phases. 

**What generates moonlight? And how do I speed it up?**

You passively generate moonlight. You don't generate moonlight while dead. Contrary to popular belief, you don't get more moonlight by hitting him more. You lose moonlight if you get hit by a red ball (red eye --&gt; 5 balls in a star pattern). **You stop generating moonlight if you get hit by anything.** This means, in P3, you need to be dodging every little bit of chip damage, at least as best you can. And especially dodge those red balls. The margins for P3 are razor tight. A single red ball can and will ruin your run. 

**There's so much shit everywhere. How the fuck do I dodge all this?**

Chasing dark orbs - if you jump into them while they are high, they will pop without you taking damage. You can also flash jump through them. TP classes have it harder, but I think you can walk into them and then TP away. 

Legs Legs Legs everywhere - Reaction time basically. Don't be stuck holding down your attack key. Get used to the timing and spacing. 

Red balls - they're pretty slow and their pattern is predictable. 

Will himself pushing you into everything - Stand on top of him. Chase ass when he readies his attack animation. In P2, with the fakeouts, you are the only one in there. He will always always aggro to you, and attack in your direction. If he's looking at you and suddenly shows you his ass, that's 100% a fakeout. 

**I'm doing my best but P3 is still hard as fuck. FUCK THESE WEBS**

When the screen is completely webbed out, don't lose hope just yet. This is the time to get all 4 resistance characters to 120. A full 9 seconds of iframe is enough to generate one cleanse. Hero's will + Erda will can buy you even more time. Krr Ring and other iframes can also help. 

And don't lose hope, even small improvements in mechanics will buy you more and more time in P3. 

**Alright I give up trying to buy time in P3. How can I do more damage?**

Burst with poison is a pretty common strat. He will usually cast poison within the first 30 seconds of starting the phase. This will give you a large final damage boost, which may be enough to shorten your p3 time. 

Dodging and attacking is difficult, but there may be class specific things you can do to avoid mechanics while still maintaining damage uptime. Watch a video of someone doing a min dmg run, or ask your class discord. 

Remember that once webbed out, it's not over yet. Stall out the timer and wait for burst to come back, so you can utilize resistance link. Ideally you should have no less than 8 lives going into P3.",Maplestory

Conditions for Hyper Burning in Burning World are good. Level 7 symbols = 900 stats. Times 6 = 5400 final stats as a starting point. Free 17* Absolab weapon. Then you get the rest of the absolab equipment in Auction House when you transfer over to reg server and it should be good enough for the lower tier bosses like CRA/Cygnus. 

I think once you get your boss mules up and running (4/5) it's better to invest the Hyper Burn on regular server to get a steady flow of Maple Points every week. So instead of doing Ursus and Maple Tour every week on Reboot, you do it on Reg Server. Then you convert mesos to maple points and use them on Reboot to buy either the pass or clover tool whenever they bring back clover event.

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/597028691830374410/803679503398207508/urus_mesos.png

So according to this chart you get 10.53 million per run. 31.5 million per day. 221.3 million per week. Don't have any information on Maple Tour but you can also add that to the list.

You can also add weekly bosses to your list which should just be CRA or below. Netting about 85 mill a week. 

Daily bosses add up to around 20 mill a day. ~140 mill a week

446.3 mill a week which should net you about 4k maple points a week.",Maplestory

I've been seeing a lot of posts here lately about how to make friends or not being able to find other players in the game as well as people commenting how the game isn't really about that anymore and is more built towards progression and getting good at the game.

With that in mind I ask: If Maplestory was a Single player game with no other player connection at all, would you still play it?

Personally I definitely wouldn't, this game has always been a social outlet for me and I think at least in the past, a lot of the reason people wanted to progress or get good at the game was to, for lack of a better word ""Show off"" their gains and skills. Even with Reboot restricting trade to further tunnel vision players onto single player paths, you can still be ""That super cool high level guy"" and strut around looking cool in your NX gear.",Maplestory

"Are bosses sometimes more difficult than others? Sometimes I fight a boss in a certain difficulty and it feels like it can be more intense than other times.

&amp;#x200B;

Take Lucid for example, in any difficulty. Sometimes on phase 1 she can cast say 20 golems on the first 5 minutes, other times it feels like she casts 100 golems in the same period of time. Numbers are just an example, like the difference between one run and another is big. I know this is a random factor and not all fights are the same but, does the random factor implies sometimes she just likes to cast 3x more golems than others? Teleport you more often than others? Summon more dragons than other times? Even while binding and doing all the sorcery in the game to pacify her, it's just random. But this ""random"" feels like it can potentially make a boss more difficult sometimes. And I'm not talking about ""a moment"" of something she did for 10 seconds, I mean the whole fight from beginning to end is sometimes more intense than others, like some days she's consistently summoning golems while other days she's like......I don't feel like it.

Yo, let me tell you 'bout a game called Maple Story,
Where players grind for hours, no need to worry.
It's an MMORPG with quests and skills,

Verse 2:
You start off in Maple Island, a newbie town,
But soon enough you'll be traveling all around.
The monsters get tougher as you level up,
And you'll need some friends to help you when things get rough.

Chorus:
Maple Story, the game that never gets old,
From Henesys to Orbis, there's always a story to be told.
The world of Maple is vast, with so much to explore,
And when you get to the top, you know you've earned more.

Verse 3:
There's warriors, mages, thieves and archers,
Each with their own unique abilities to master.
You'll need to train your stats and gear up your character,
And when you're ready for the boss, you know you'll have to battle her.

Verse 4:
The community is great, with guilds and alliances,
You'll make some friends for life, and have some epic experiences.
From PQs to bosses, and events galore,
There's always something to do, you'll never be bored.

""Raging Blow"" does less damage all around no matter what you do and they also scale the same for Nodes. 

and I feel like i should mention this to some people because apparently this is a shared across multiple hero mains for some reason????????? but raging blow and puncture has the SAME EXACT attack speed, just because you tell me to pop a green pot doesn't mean shit now i will say i can see how some people don't know that much about animations so they maybe get confused because raging blow LOOKS faster but it's not. they will STILL have the same exact attack speed, i feel like that should have been obvious but that's just me idk

Furthermore, using the hacks on a 2nd account allows for him to have plausible deniability by claiming he is not affiliated with that account or he was not the one using it etc etc. The problem is, regardless of the hacks being using a 2nd account the primary benefactor of the increased spawn rates was his main account.

"another stupid question hello there, apologies for the dumb question. i used to know maplestory very well but it has changed so much since i used to play. i tried googling the answer but couldnt get a clear answer.

i enjoy doing the monster collection it reminds me of the very old days when there were quests such as kill 999 undead mushrooms haha. a long time ago you could only add a monster to your collection if you were within a certain number of levels of the monster, but recently i happened to add a monster even though it was considerably lower than my characters level.

so my question is, do you need to be close to the level of the monsters you are killing to add them to your collection or is that no longer a thing? oh and while im here, are all monsters still able to be collected? i noticed the prime minister mushroom guy is in the collection but the mushroom kingdom has changed and he is no longer a boss you fight.",Maplestory
"What can KMS do fix their issue? I think most of us aware of the shit going down in the KMS community. But to be honest, its actually kinda of hard to solve the issue. I can only see 2 option for them, resusing what i commented in another post.

1. Buff reg server. But how can they go about it? Buffing the reg server have a few implications depending how its implemented, it may break the economy. Or if the give reg server too much of a power creep, advancing all the F2P/low spenders in reg server too much, to a point where the whales they they over-spent was required would still result cause they medium/big spending players to be unhappy. And i believe those are also the bulk of the players that are making nexon the money.

2. Nerf the reboot servers. I don't think i need to explain why nerfing reboot server would be a bad move, but its the easiest way to appease the ""angry"" non-reboot players in my opinion. But of course that still have the implication of reboot players that have already benefitted if the banning of trading/selling carries for progression is their main nerf to reboot.

Not that I want to defend wonki or the KMS game developers but because shitting on other people's solution is easy and giving a good one is hard. I would like what to know what you guys think are some possible solutions and be in depth about the analysis on why it would work, and why the pros would outweigh the cons.

"Opinion: I don't think much of the potential KMS Reboot Nerfs will carry over to GMS I know GMS has been following KMS updates for the past few years...but I dont think all this doom-mongering is warranted.

First of all, the VAST majority of GMS players are on Reboot. In KMS, the nerfs ""make sense"" since reg servers are way more popular and make up a vast majority of their revenue. I dont want what the revenue distribution looks like in GMS, but there is no way the handful of whales is more valuable than the profit potential from the Reboot population. They can always add incentives, and nobody will care as much as serverwide nerfs.

Second, despite the trend of aligning w/ KMS, GMS Reboot has it's own identity. Easier progression from AS-0, Gollux, better cubing, ex-totems and boss crystal prices (higher than the KMS scheme) are so ingrained I doubt any drastic nerfs will carry over - especially given the recent direction towards easing progression. Two pieces of evidence: 1) Compensating totem removal w/ boss crystal meta (better than KMS' dynamic pricing scheme) and 2) cubes were NOT nerfed to KMS rates, as previously suspect.

I can see boss carries getting nerfed, which sucks but not even that bad imo - but as far as cubing/SF goes, there's just no way.",Maplestory

"What kind of nerfs/changes to boss carries would you be OK with on reboot? So with the recent controversy, the only thing they've outright stated they wanted to do to the Reboot server was target boss carrying to prevent players from skipping content to get to lategame faster.

It's not clear whether they want to target only the RWT side of things, or make sweeping changes to how boss carrying works in Reboot though.

&amp;#x200B;

I strongly believe that being able to trade carries or get carried to bosses within a range is a core part of how reboot functions now, especially for bossing mules where I think it's totally unreasonable to make gear like CRA and Absolab equipment less accessible as mules would just take more effort than they're worth.

However I think there's no problem with removing the ability to get carried for anything midgame and on (basically NLuwill and up). Bossing mules certainly do not need Arcane equipment, and I don't have an issue with mains needing to work to progress beyond Abso.

&amp;#x200B;

I think the best approach would be:

* Record each players damage towards a boss individually, and use that to determine whether or not players have contributed enough to get a drop
* Have the damage contribution be quite generous. With a 6 person party, if all players damage the boss equally, they'd all do 16.66% of the boss's HP, but it's expected that some players may get their burst off quicker, just simply be stronger than players they're partying with, or some classes may contribute more in other ways like support abilities, so I think a more fair contribution would be around 5-8%. This would scale with party size and cap out at around 30% for a duo.

Option 1:

This restriction would only apply to Midgame bosses and beyond, and for hard versions of early game bosses like Lomien it'd only apply to Pitched Boss set drops and not Abso boxes (so players could trade HLomien carries for Abso, but they wouldn't be able to give Pitched drops to people they're carrying)

Option 2:

This restriction would apply to ALL bosses, however some drops would be transferable within account, such as Lucid/Will Droplets, Damien's Stone, Lotus's Core, CRA Usables, Arcane/Abso equipment boxes (stuff used to get equipment, but not the actual equipment itself). 

This would make it so no players can skip content on their main, but as long as they can contribute enough to get normal gear (not rare drops like pitched/dawn boss set items) on one of their characters, they can claim that gear on whatever character they choose so it's still reasonable to gear up Boss Mules.

It would however make the game more centered around solo play, as trading carries to gear up mules would be replaced with just transferring spare gear boxes/tokens to buy gear from shops from your main to your side characters.

"Full rotation/DPM metric is outdated. Black Mage has been a washed boss since final damage changes.  350b/s vs 280/s full 2 minutes or 4 minutes, like who cares.  This number is meaningless when newer bosses are constantly moving around and you have to dodge twenty something patterns that kill you.  You really think people will have even 60% DPM uptime on a boss like Kalos when you have to have to dodge several 1 shot/high % HP mechanics but also play fucking bloons before getting wiped by a 4 gate activation?  Hell, even most Kalos clears are just parties one-bursting a segment and then playing a mobile minigame to cleanse the gate until the next segment.  Kaling has an enormous HP pool that it only makes sense to burst the boss down with several final damage sources and maybe an Illium iframe (don't sleep on this class btw) and gene iframe.  Before the old metric was 40 seconds for Lucid P3, but because that boss is now irrelevant to most players, it was phased out for the current bil per second/full rotation BAs.  But now those BA's are irrelevant for Kalos, Kaling , and probably Seren since she's washed and gets bursted down before sunset. 

 I think a new standard is required going forward; the 20s BA.  This accounts for 15 seconds on bind and 5s on gene iframe and is much more realistic for Nexon's modern design on bossing.  Playing full DPM is too punishing where so much can go wrong and you can drop from 5 to 1 life in less than 30 seconds.  Meanwhile burst is low risk-high reward, guaranteed to get your damage off without losing a life.  I feel like an absolutely donkey playing Paladin when I could've just played Night Lord and spread throwed my cheeks and afk, dealing more damage than any DPM class could.

"Progression through midgame I'm a returning player with a 252 NW in reboot (hyperburned) and am having troubles figuring my best course of progression going forward. The last time I seriously played was when Reboot/5th job first came out, and the game has changed quite a bit. I'm currently at 22k stat and 4.2k legion, around 10-11M range self buffed for my solo boss runs. The big dilemma is figuring out how to best progress from here. My current gear is as follows: fake abso, 3 set CRA, 3 set reinforced (no pend), tyrant cape, nova shoes, japan gloves, princess no shoulder. Rings are Kanna/Rein/Event/Event. Pendants are Greed and CHT (no dominator yet). I have full meso gear and a 2x drop line accessory for meso farming while training. Bosses I've soloed thus far: 4 door, hellux, cpap, hmag, aketchi. AF is a little low (about 790). I have a few questions:

1. Should I go for 5 set real abso or perhaps skip and just start waiting for arcane? My tyrant cape is 5 stars and nova shoes are 8 stars so comparatively they are decent placeholders. Both dumb investments from an efficiency standpoint, I know. But i've never run lomien (don't even have either prequest done tbh lol) and wanted to upgrade those slots from pensalir. Which is why I have a princess no shoulder and japan gloves as well. I understand this is not a traditional gearing progression but I'm not fussed about it and enjoyed making the gains along the way. Alternatively, should I try to practice normal luwill and just skip 5 set abso for arcane? From my understanding my 22k stat should be near the ballpark of required stat, but with lower legion at 4.2k and fake abso, my BD/IED/Crit dmg are on the lower end admittedly (about 180% BD, and 90% visual IED with a 2x line IED secondary equipped). I understand I should probably learn lomien and luwill simultaneously but from a meso efficiency standpoint, should I just save for my arcanes and forgo SF'ing and cubing a 5 set abso? 
2. As I am accumulating CRA fodder, is getting to 20-22 star 3 set a decent upgrade path? Before I even get 5 set abso or start to get my arcane pieces
3. Is now a time to start for 6k legion or is trying to rush to 260 for Sac symbols better as I understand that is another massive timegate.

I guess being a relatively inexperienced player in this current iteration of Maple has me feeling a bit lost. I don't have the greatest hands so starting new bosses such as lotus, damien, lucid and will seems like a daunting challenge. And I'd hate to join a run and be deadweight to my party. I've solo'ed all of my bosses thus far, with the exception of an early 4 door CRA carry to replace my temp hyper burning set. Don't even want to touch Oz. I'm a relatively casual player (maybe 5-10 hrs a week) but still to progress but efficiently. Any advice is appreciated!",Maplestory

"[KMS] Planning Manager hints possible Reboot Nerf **Reboot cube prices could rise** following the Reboot drama in KMS (Could change in the future)

He said ""Level of difficulty of Reboot has been mitigated for several years but no financial adjustments were made regarding the money required for character's growth in Reboot. These include prices of cubes and flames. Consequently, early growth speed has been heavily accerelated.

(Reboot became easier to make money. To make things fair for normal servers and to adjust difficulty, we might raise price of cubes and flames)

Other than that he revealed future Maplestory directions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. **Better Boss Mechanic**: 99% unavoidable deaths ex) Lucid Teleporting you during dragon breath, will be fixed
2. Player Leveling: 250-260 Section should be much faster to level
3. Gear improvements: We are aware that to become significantly stronger, one must upgrade a gear part completly(ex) From 10 star epic item to 22 star legendary). We will try to make sure gear can be upgraded step to step, but we need to approach this very carefully thus needing more research.
4. Appropriate counter measures against RWT Bosses in Reboot. This is against Reboot's main purpose, to enjoy MMORPG w/o market factors.

TLDR: We're sorry, we're gonna make improvements but we cannot specify anything yet

&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;TLDR  
&gt;  
&gt;\-&gt; Nexon will implement the way to moving on to next gears step-by-step

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;●보스  
캐릭터의 강함을 확인할수 있는 가장 효과적인 수단인 동시에 목표.  
연습모드를 포함한 보스컨텐츠에 대한 도전 제한도, 스펙구간별 재미경험에 대한 의문  
보스몬스터의 패턴이 성장경험이나 컨트롤로 극복할수 없거나 의욕상실 등등  
&gt;  
&gt;▶패턴 개선을 통해 보스경험 재미 증대  
  
&gt;  
&gt;\*Boss  
&gt;  
&gt;Nexon recognize that Boss is the most effective way to measure how strong the characters are.  
&gt;  
&gt;Nexon also recognize that there are many limits to challenge bosses (including practice mode) at current stage.   
&gt;  
&gt;\[Note: Changsup mentioned things like number of challenges per day, 30 minutes waiting time, practice mode existence (Seren Kalos doesn't have practice mode), and etc. are making difficult to challenge bosses\]  
&gt;  
&gt;Nexon also recognizes that some of bosses mech are impossible to overcome with micros and gowth(lvl, better gears, etc).  
&gt;  
&gt;\[Note: Changsup said they are going to implement re-designed boss mechs in March. As example, he specifically points out ""Lucid dragon summon and teleport mech together in 1st phase"", ""those meteor map patterns in gloom, darknell, bm, mag, and etc"", and ""survivability CPap and Magus"" \]  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;TLDR  
&gt;  
&gt;\-&gt; We will re-design shitty boss patterns  

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;●월드 간 고유 경험 ( 일반월드 - 리부트 )  
&gt;  
&gt;im going to put entire script here  
&gt;  
&gt;네, 끝으로 저희 월드간 고유한 경험, 즉 일반월드와 리부트 월드에 대한 저희 개발진의 입장과 앞으로 방향성에 대해서 말씀을 드리며, 개발 방향성에 대한 설명을 마무리할까 합니다.  
&gt;  
&gt;일단 먼저 사과의 말씀을 드리면 지금까지 저희는 '일반 월드와 리부트 월드는 전혀 다른 경험을 제공하는 월드다' 라고 하는 그 명제 하나만 맹신하며, 리부트 월드 고유의 경험과 일반 월드와의 차별성에 대해서 추가적인 논의나 검토를 많이 게을리 했다고 생각합니다.  
&gt;  
&gt;리부트 월드는 MMORPG인 메이플스토리에서 MMO 적인 재미의 핵심인 시장경제를 완전히 배제하고 보다 높은 성장 난이도를 설정하여 RPG적인 재미를 극대화한 일종의 실험적인 시도였고, 도입 초기에는 그 의도에 맞게 잘 동작하며 일반 월드와는 분명히 구별된 게임성을 가지고 있었습니다.  
&gt;  
&gt;저희는 시장경제의 유무가 게임을 즐기는 과정 자체를 완전히 다르게 만드는 요인이기 때문에 그 차이는 이후 업데이트가 어떤식으로 진행되더라도 절대로 좁혀지지 않을 것이라고 다소 안일하게 생각했습니다.  
&gt;  
&gt;그러니까 일반 월드는 시장경제가 있기 때문에, 성장의 과정에서 ""직접 플레이한다"" 라고 하는 것 이외에 다양한 선택지들, 예를 들건데 장비 성장을 가속한다거나, 개인 확률 경험을 생략한다거나, 또는 원치 않는 컨텐츠를 플레이하지 않는 것 같은 여러 선택지들이 존재하는 반면에, 리부트 월드는 모두 오롯이 직접 플레이하는 재미 이외에 선택지는 존재하지 않습니다.  
&gt;  
&gt;하지만 최근 들어서 리부트 월드에서도 소위 말하는 보스 먹자 파티가 성행을 하며 일반 월드의 시장경제가 주고 있는 그 플레이 방식이 유사하게 동작하게 되었습니다. 그리고 이러한 현상은 캐릭터 성장의 난이도가 리부트 월드가 처음 투입되었던 초기 의도에 비해서 쉬워진 것 과도 깊은 연관이 있다고 생각을 합니다.  
&gt;  
&gt;실제로 리부트 월드는 지금까지 일반 월드에 진행된 대부분의 패치와 이벤트들이 함께 반영이 되었고, 그 결과 메소의 수급 난이도와 캐릭터 성장의 난이도는 다소 쉬워졌습니다. 하지만 그에 비해 장비 성장에 필요한 요소들, 큐브라거나 환생의 불꽃 같은 재료들의 메소 가격은 리부트 월드가 투입된 이후에도 한 번도 변경되지 않음으로서 리부트 월드의 RPG적 난이도 완화를 더욱 가속시켰던 것 같습니다.  
&gt;  
&gt;이런 모든 요소들을 사실 저희가 잘 살피고 사전에 조치하여서 저희가 처음에 그렇게 생각했고 많은 용사님들께서도 얼마 전까지 그렇게 생각하셨던 것 처럼, '리부트 월드는 일반 월드와 전혀 다른 게임을 하는 곳이야' 라고 하는 그 명제가 절대로 위협받지 않았어야 했는데 저희의 불찰로 그 명제가 최근에 다소 위협을 받았던 것 같습니다.  
&gt;  
&gt;이어지는 업데이트에서는 항상 이것이 일반 월드와 리부트 월드 고유의 플레이 경험과 난이도 설계에 적절한 내용인가를 반드시 검토하여 두 월드에 구별된 경험이 제공될 수 있도록 최선을 다하겠습니다.  
&gt;  
&gt;그리고 지난 방송에서 먹자 파티 같은 경우에는 저희 운영팀장님께서 운영적인 방법을 통한 제재를 말씀드렸었는데요, 그것에 더불어서 시스템적인 변화가 동반되어야만, 앞서 말씀드린 리부트 월드 고유 경험, 즉 모든 것을 직접 수행하는 그 재미를 진정으로 제공할 수 있을 거라고 생각합니다. 해당 부분에 대해서는 최대한 빠른 시일 내에 업데이트로 반영을 하여 보여드리겠습니다.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
일반월드와 리부트는 별개라고 생각하여 둘 간의 차이에 대한 검토 등이 제대로 되지 않았음.  
일반월드는 시장경제의 존재로 인한 다양한 선택지가 있었음.  
리부트월드는 이의 부재로 인하여 모두 직접 하는것 말고는 선택지가 없었음.

For example, in x3TheAran59's video where he cleared the boss on JMS with the bow master, he is only taking 498 damage per tic that is respect to being 1% of the character's hp

"Is MapleStory as focused on communities nowadays? Old school MapleStory player here. I haven't touched the game in almost a decade since the launch of Reboot in 2015, and even then, I was returning to MapleStory from a pre-big bang era.

Well, you know the saying ""you never really quit, you just take long breaks""? I think it's happening to me again and I'm reconsidering looking into MapleStory again.

However, this time I don't have any friends joining me to play so I'll be doing a solo grind. The game felt very single played focused when I returned to it during Reboot, as no one was really interested in socializing, and the game is a lot faster with people powering through the levels compared to pre-big bang.

I know that guilds likely still exist, but is the culture of the game more focused on soloing bosses now, as well as playing individually rather than joining party questions with other folks?

This will likely be a deal breaker for me, as I don't think I can enjoy the game without an active in game community. Even when I was a kid and played, I made so many awesome friends and socializing was half the fun. I think a huge reason I became a social person and enjoy chatting online is because of MapleStory!",Maplestory

"How do YOU deal with ""spending impatience""? Context: Reboot. Got boss mules up and running, earn a steady stream of mesos per week (20b+). Am more or less in endgame state in terms of equips (some SF left, some 3L cubing left, some min-maxing flames, you get the deal).

Ideally, you save up for events (like cube sale, 5/10/15 or SSF) and throw your savings at the game in order to make progress. Problem for me is that every time I have a decent sum of meso saved up (50b or so), I get incredibly tempted to do some off-event spending in order to make some gains. I know this isn't efficient at all (especially on SF), but at the same time I just enjoy seeing some progress, even if it's far from efficient. I generally regret spending my mesos afterwards thinking I should've just saved up for an event instead.

I was wondering how others deal with this. To the players who are able to save up huge sums of mesos (over 100b, basically) without having the urge to spend in between, what advice do you have to those like me who can't resist that urge? What holds you from just getting that progress right away?",Maplestory

I was trying to figure out what nodes I should have for my newly made ice lightning mage, I didn't know so I popped up in the explorer mage discord.

I just joined a the server a couple days ago and I'm finding them to be really toxic. I got pretty much made fun of today for asking for help, and a couple laughing memes were even used.

I apologized for not being the brightest and even mentioned that I'm on the spectrum and I have issues. I'm not as young as these zoomers and discord is quite difficult to use sometimes. I didn't know how to ask a question properly and I got made laughed at for wording it wrong. It all left me feeling really depressed and ashamed, to where I actually cried.

I realized I'll probably have to suck it up because I don't know if there's any other way to get more information. I was so excited to play my mage after doing my monster park dailies, but realize ice lightning mage probably isn't for me if I can't even progress on it properly.

I went from 3.1k to 6k in 4-5 weeks

I filled in crit dmg and bd grid already and am just missing IED. However at my level I'm most likely just gonna be going up to H lomien and not anything higher anytime soon.

Is it worth pushing to 8k? it's kinda harder now because it means I have to push my 15X characters to 200 

Currently I have most link skills level 2 with merc and da at lvl3.

My shade hayato jett are all 200 already (15 crit damage trio)
Marksman and NL (200) for the 8% crit rate

Should I take a break from legion grinding and return to 8k later or do people usually just go to 8k and then stop? 

I have a 30% ied line on my emblem and a 50% ied from a legendary familiar. 

This is why i'm thinking of stopping at 6k because I don't neccessarily need the IED until i reach BM and stuff? and it's better to just level my main? but I'm indecisive because many people are telling me to just push to 8k with the haste event.

"Questions about progressing main + boss mules Hey all, sorry if its a long one.

Returning player from big bang-ish era into reboot server. Started with \~2 weeks left in ignition and have not touched grass since, and have kind of hit a lull.

My main (239 bucc hyperburn) is waiting for nLomien drops so that I can complete my 5 set abso (I have shoulder, glove, and fake absolab weapon). It is around 17k stat, 92 ied, 180 boss with links + legion. I have 0 drop or meso gear, only a 19% item drop IA and HS node, so farming it quite slow. I will need 5 more weeks for the rest of my abso gear and I am curious what I should be doing in that time and if there are any more ways to optimize my progress.

So far daily on my main I am doing: CPQ for sweetwater face + eye, daily bosses/ursus, mapletour for meso, and arcane dailies.

In the extra time I have I had been spamming characters to 140 and am at around 29 characters at 140 (some above, some below), for 4k legion, and am sick and tired of that.

Due to that, two of the characters I made I have decided to start progressing to become future bossing mules. They are roughly in the same spot, (180 Adele + 165 DB), pensailir gear around 10 star, and have been attempting to cube it all to epic 6%, and fill out the boss slots I need still (PB cup, magnus shoulder/badge, CHT ring + pendent).

Daily on my bossing mules (starting as of today, lol), will be CPQ for sweetwater weapon, daily bosses (prob just emag for drops, RA for CRA req, Hilla, and Von leon).

For the specific questions I had:

1. For my main, is the anything else I should be doing? I am cubing the abso gear as I get it, was probably gonna park it at 15-17 stars later down the road as I am poor as shit.
2. Should I switch focus from cubing abso gear to getting drop/meso gear? I have most accessories at legendary or unique 2L main stat, except two rings that are 9% epic, which I could cube for meso/drop gear first.
3. For my bossing mules, I have been considering compiling the Hilla set for cheap star force + cubing, then transfering to Von Leon set rather than pensailir gear that I already have for supposed better set effect for bossing to reach CRA faster. Many of my searches have been unclear on what the generally recommended method is for what set to use the CRA.
4. My bossing mules training is slowing down dramatically, and I used growth potions to get them higher up, I am 3-5 shotting mobs, so what equips am I missing that mules would generally use? Side note, I would like to get one of them to 5th job so that I can get the haste shop nodes for them.
5. Recommended stats to start CRA struggles, or if I should just wait it out to solo?

I have been following the ohlunar/ohadele guide to 10k legion, so I think I have most of the critical links/legions 

Also, any other tips you have to make the progression a little bit faster or if I am missing anything would be greatly appreciated.",Maplestory

[Further to my post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Maplestory/comments/114487o/reboot_where_to_grind_sellas_to_limina_edition/), I have decided to create a document with all maps from Vanishing Journey to Limina.

"[REBOOT] Where to grind - Sellas to Limina Edition  **Please note:** this 'guide'/help is only for people who want to maximize exp rates... Not meso/familiar/node rates.

It's  been a while since Totems were removed, and with that, the whole 'one  map is best' should have went with it... However I see a lot of people  haven't actually caught up to that, and religiously stick to one map for  5-10 levels. The common advice is 'run a BA and go with the highest  kill rate map that you have access to'... this is actually not true most  of the time and can actually stunt your EXP rates.

Lots  of people overlook the 20% bonus base experience that is granted for  within 1 level of the mob you are killing.... A simplified way of  thinking of this is 15k kills within 1 level range = 18k kills at base  exp.

I have attached a few tables I  have made using information about spawn points I have gathered from  various places, including reddit, inven &amp; checking maps myself when really dubious about a number. It's likely these are not all correct, feel free to correct anything you feel is not true, I didn't check every single map, I am not that insane!

The tables  outline the base EXP per hour if you full clear the map, then goes on  to show your exp rates depending on your level difference...The result  is that maps really only have a 1-2 level shelf life for being the  optimum map for your experience.

But actually when you are lvl 252 you only make  26.8B, and MF1(27.7b),MF3 (29.6b) and MF4(29.3b) and even MF5 (28.2b)  become better maps if you can clear them. They also likely have better  burning. Also, in Sellas, you have the option of SSS6, which will still  give you 30.4b (but no familiars).

With  all these options available there is a much higher chance of finding  maps that are burning: With all exp modifiers running, you are looking  at around 3% total exp per 10% of burning. So 100% burning would be 30%  total on top of the rates listed here.

**Lab vs Moonbridge:**

I  see people staying in LH6 until Limina, and skipping Labyrinth. However  there are actually tons of viable in Labyrinth that beat out Moonbridge  &amp; Limina at the same levels... Limina only really becomes better at  level 260/261 in most cases, at which point you would probably want to  swap to Cernium as the rates there are just insanely better (unless you  are funded enough to clear the Powerful 1k AF mobs which are better from  the moment you unlock Limina, which are always better).

**TLDR:**  for optimum exp rates, people should be swapping maps nearly every  level from 245 onwards (and probably before, but I haven't got time to  look up every single map in the Arcane River right now).

**NOTE:**  if your only goal is to get familiars and mesos/nodes. You should just  stay in the highest kill count map. If your goal is to level up faster,  then you should go for the highest EXP per hour map, not the highest  kill per hour.

**NOTE:** These rates are really just comparison guides, it's really unlikely you will maintain the 'optimum' rates in any map.

I hope this helps! If it is useful maybe I can do lvl 200-280 rather than just 245-260",Maplestory
"Where to grind! Sellas -Limina Edition [reboot only] **Please note:** this 'guide'/help is only for people who want to maximize exp rates... Not meso/familiar/node rates.

It's been a while since Totems were removed, and with that, the whole 'one map is best' should have went with it... However I see a lot of people haven't actually caught up to that, and religiously stick to one map for 5-10 levels. The common advice is 'run a BA and go with the highest kill rate map that you have access to'... this is actually not true most of the time and can actually stunt your EXP rates.

Lots of people overlook the 20% bonus base experience that is granted for within 1 level of the mob you are killing.... A simplified way of thinking of this is 15k kills within 1 level range = 18k kills at base exp.

I have attached a few tables I have made using information about spawn points I have gathered from various places, including checking myself when I doubt the number I find online - these may not all be accurate and I'd appreciate if somebody would correct any numbers that are wrong, but they should be a helpful guide to choosing maps. 

The tables outline the base EXP per hour if you full clear the map, then goes on to show your exp rates depending on your level difference...The result is that maps really only have a 1-2 level shelf life for being the optimum map for your experience.

**For example**: You can make 29.2B base exp per hour at LH4 When you are lvl 249, level 250, and level 251... But actually when you are lvl 252 you only make 26.8B, and MF1(27.7b),MF3 (29.6b) and MF4(29.3b) and even MF5 (28.2b) become better maps if you can clear them. They also likely have better burning.

"Should I be worried about Maple shut down? Real talk: Should I be worried about maple ending? Will my dailies and bossing be for nothing right now?

I have been looking at sentiment across all of reddit, in Steve (X3TheAran59) and his youtube vids/streams where they reacted live to Wonky's shenanigans, and I have seen the whole gambit of responses

""Maple will be fine, this isn't even serious""

""Maple will be fine if they replace him""

""Reg servers gonna crash and burn, everyone quit and move to reboot""

""All of Maplestory is gonna shut down because of this. The playerbase's trust is permanently damaged""

And from what I've heard, the majority opinion from KMS so far is in the lower half of this response tierlist. I could be totally off base though

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just wanting to get you guys' opinions. I know all overseas regions only account for like 5-10% of the total playerbase so our opinions are worth precisely 1 dog turd, but still worth talking about

I personally think Maple brings in too much money for Nexon, for them to just pull the plug on the whole party. 

But you never know...Wonky's comment about ""we are a dying genre"" could've been influenced by higher ups talking to him saying Maple is dying 

and they know the game will end soon, which prompted him to make that statement, and his other ones, and he's like ""fuck it we're in endgame so I might as well say what I really feel!""",Maplestory

"Some details about Kaling's P1's mechanics so far Taken from various streamers, namu wiki, an inven posts:

Level: 285

Sacred Power req: 330 for full damage

P1 is made up of three minibosses - the Perils introduced in Hoyoung's storyline sans Taotie - towards which you can allocate up to **two** players to during the entry period. All of the minibosses are immune to binds, and must be defeated in order to enter P2. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Player allocation menu](https://preview.redd.it/jvd0gxdbslia1.png?width=1487&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=fd31320d56aa64ff77b00322a779d2b26b9a313d)

Player allocation menu

&amp;#x200B;

The party shares a 1000 mental point ""life total"", which is drained when being hit by certain patterns. There is no life count as in most other bosses - dying simply removes 50 mental points.

&amp;#x200B;

[Mental point meter](https://preview.redd.it/b1zjz6pyqlia1.png?width=260&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=907364539690069bf339d224860195109cdff1fb)

The major mechanic of P1 is the **balance gauge**, which is divided into three segments, one for each boss**.** At the start of the fight, each miniboss will have 500 points of this gauge, summing to 1500. It seems that being hit from certain patterns will increase your miniboss' gauge, while decreasing one or both of the other gauges such that the sum remains as 1500. Certain attacks (notably the Lucid P1-like lines) deal health damage but not mental point damage; thus, the party needs to coordinate tanking these to maintain the balance gauge. 

[Balance gauge](https://preview.redd.it/x4sjer9zslia1.png?width=259&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=770e8272590b89ef2745fb643487ab0a58076cab)

&amp;#x200B;

[Tanking the yellow string seemed to add 60 blue gauge and remove 60 yellow, failing that segment](https://preview.redd.it/1xg8yfhhtlia1.png?width=1276&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=4c0e4d440a158ad9bf949408962bdf2dc0b718e7)

[350 mental point loss for failing a segment \(860-350\)](https://preview.redd.it/ku5agotvtlia1.png?width=1279&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=7066b751667522929b97cd1803045c9f1c6f811b)

If any segment of the balance gauge reaches 0 or 1000, the party will lose 350 mental points. Furthermore, it will permanently throw the balance gauge off balance; it will no longer sum to 1500, and it appears that players in the failed section will be no longer be able to influence the other bosses' gauges. Also, the party will be denied the miniboss-specific buff for any failed segments upon entry to P2.

&amp;#x200B;

[An unbalanced gauge](https://preview.redd.it/ky0x4kw9tlia1.png?width=192&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=014cb7b7bdcf05aa51c3250abad0958ec786cc27)

Each miniboss has its own mechanics; notably, these encounters are very asymmetrical. It seems that the yellow bird is the safest, followed by the blue bull and lastly the black dog. Also, defeating one miniboss allows the members to move maps to assist with another. Thus, party comps will likely need to allocate players such that the strongest players fight the bird, while support classes survive and help manage gauge versus the black dog.",Maplestory

"Switch main or wait until next hyper burning event? Hey,


I made a Dawn Warrior on EU Reboot for ignition and managed to get him to 241. I did not particularly enjoy the class and ended up getting 6.6k legion over the period instead. After playing a bunch of classes I really started to find Shadower enjoyable and a bit more hands-on regarding abilities when bossing.

I already managed to get the trinodes [Dark flare, Cruel stab, Meso explosion] x 2 and [Sudden raid, Dark veil, Assassinate] x 2 for the Shadower and is currently lv. 202 from daily bossing with around ~30B mesos in the bank.

I managed to solo 4-door CRA on DW and get 17-star CRA equipment/boots/gloves/etc, fake AbsoWep and a bunch of event rings sitting at 14k STR. Don't really know how hard it is to reach that point again without all the freebies?

Should I just bite the bullet and grind without hyper burning + milestone loot or focus on trying to get 8k legion for next hyper burning event? So I guess I'm left with the following options:

1. Get 8k Legion and wait for hyper burning

2. Get 8k Legion while doing dailies + monster park on shadower

3. Full out train the shadower putting a pause on legion grind

"Summary of KR Meeting They said are aiming for the longevity of both Reboot as well as the regular server. I recall in Savior showcase they were rather conservative about saying anything related to Reboot which worried some players. It looks like they are at least making it clear that they at least won't cease one over another and will try to focus some QoL stuff on Reboot as well.

Regarding improvements to Reboot, they feel as if the self-progression aspect of gearing up and progressing through your character on your own has gone tangent and would like to focus on this area.

For regular server, they currently don't have much of action item planned ahead as this controversy isn't stemmed from recent change made to the game. One thing they mentioned for sure is that they have no plans to make untradable endgame equips tradable.


They will work on banning paid boss runs

"QOL we need in future updates Destiny, Ignition, and the upcoming Savior update have been going hard adding lots of QOL updates to make a bunch of stuff throughout the game feel a lot less clunky and inconsistent, but there's still quite a few things I'd like to see fixed.

Instead of focusing on specific skills, I'm just gunna list broad changes I think should apply to all classes:

* **Skills with Cooldowns should be able to be put on Macros:**   
This would make a lot of classes' burst cycles feel so much less clunky to set up
* **Macros with only Buff/Toggle skills should activate all skills in the Macro simultaneously:**  
Same reason as above, and makes it so you can't move a little early and not activate the last skill in the macro, which is especially annoying with Toggles
* **All skills with cooldowns that have 100% up time (cd is same as duration) should have their cooldown removed:**  
Not having this just makes changing maps or dying without a buff freezer feel so much worse than it needs to be
* **Skills with near 100% up time should be adjusted to be 100% up time:**  
Imo if something is like 160 duration 180 cd just nerf the damage by like 1-160/180 and remove the cooldown. It's more of a grey area if the skill's duration is 80% or less of the cd, but if it's like 85-90% I think it's fine to do this across the board.
* **Binds don't activate cooldown if nothing is hit:**  
A lot of bosses warp around or go untargetable randomly, so this would just prevent losing out on a bind for no reason. I don't think any binds have anything like i-frames that'd make this cause any issues...

* Players can use NPC chat key to change hats at any time

* Gas dispenser removed
* Spin attack has a wind-up
* Rate of Meteors falling caps out at about half the current max

Lotus:

* Cannot drop the Meat Grinder Mobile thing (red thing that OHKOs) when lightning floor attack is coming up (lasts from when the platforms are dropped until the lightning completes)

Lucid:

* Golems on P1 have a 1 second or so windup on spawning
* Remove P1 random teleporting or at least make it so she can't use it while dragon is out / teleport you on top of a golem

Will:

* Summons / Familiars attacking will during P1 test does not count as attacking (just an unnecessary inconvenience for classes with lots of summons)
* P3 White and Orange eyes attacks should change his body's color as well (most of the time when he uses these attacks his eyes are obscured by some other mechanic so you can't tell which one he's using)
* P3 Aoe of cleanse should scale with remaining number of players (so it's possible to not get completely webbed when the remaining players is 1-2)

"Friendly reminder about map etiquette. #1 (The golden rule): If you take a portal, you are willingly opening up the map to be taken regardless if it’s for event purposes or otherwise. If it has been taken after you leave said portal, you may politely ask to have it back but they are entitled to refuse as the map was empty when they arrived.

#2: On bigger maps, before you start farming, double check the corners of the map to see if someone is on the outer ends of their rotation. This helps to avoid clashing view points. This could be easily fixed if Nexon would show all characters on the minimap regardless of how close/far you are from each other.

#3: Communicate before starting KS wars. It’s simply just a lose-lose situation if you don’t.

#4 (Optional but helpful): Have a recording software such as shadow-play handy in case a solution/agreement cannot be met. Hard evidence always helps.

Hope this helps alleviate possible discourse in the future. 

Happy Mapling!",Maplestory

"What is the reason for an aggressive divide between reboot and regular servers? What’s the deal with reboot players always being at odds with regular server and vice versa. Like during totem-gate the majority of reg server players were against it in solidarity with reboot because it hurt them WAYYY more than it hurt reg servers. Anyone who was in support of totem removal was shut down (correctly so) by saying “just because it doesn’t effect you doesn’t mean you shouldn’t stand with your fellow gamers” or something along those lines. Yet here we see that reboot players are simply saying “tough luck” to anyone upset by the fact that non-reboot is objectively harder to progress in. When reg servers are simply asking for equality when it comes to progress and making the game more balanced between both reboot and reg.

"Jett Continues to ""Impress"" (I'm Stuck on the Spaceship for an Hour AGAIN) I don't even know what's going on with Jett and if mine is just especially broken...

I started this character a few days ago and I'm confused. Here's what playing Jett is like in 2023:

You start the story out, blah blah blah, until you reach level 10 and Kyrin tells you that she will expect you to help around the Nautilus. Usually this would mean quests from Nautilus NPCs, right? But no. There's only one quest available and it's level 20+, so for the first time in a very long time in maplestory, I'm off to grind to level 20. Yay.

At level 20 I go back to this quest and get sent to Perion. One of the signposts triggers a quest where I have to pick up five items from local stumps (which Jett describes as ""asking them"" about what happens in her dialogue?). Nothing is dropping, so I check the quest log, which now says I'm supposed to be hunting dark axe stumps, which are actually two maps away and which weren't mentioned at any point when accepting the quest. Yay. Drop rate is super low for a pre- level 30 quest.

While in Perion I get given the skill to return to the spaceship. Like most return skills, it has a 10 minute cooldown, but the spaceship only has one exit, and it's a teleporter with a 1 hour cooldown. I test it out and, sure enough, using the skill again within the hour gets you stuck in the spaceship. I have no level 70 Mercedes on this world and since I'm not level 30 yet I can't use the maple guide, so... I log out and log back in a few hours later.

[This dialogue appears both when you talk to Abbes and when you try to use the portal.](https://preview.redd.it/dqyio2g264ia1.jpg?width=1366&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3f0dd4b9ae2b4d1eb63b2685bdae3bfdf0046808)

According to you guys, there used to be a way to exit to the Nautilus immediately through the portal on the right, but at least one other player confirms recently starting a new Jett and getting trapped there too without having that option. But hey, it's not like returning to the spaceship will be important any time soon, right? (obvious ominous foreshadowing).

Having logged back in, I complete the drop quest and taxi from Perion to Ellinia for the next step because Jett does not seem to get auto-teleported anywhere (honestly I don't mind that) and I'm not risking the spaceship again. Off to talk to Fanzy, who sends me on a mandatory jump quest. Great. I thought we were done with those.

This is no regular jump quest, though, because they didn't actually set the map to limit your jump and speed to the expected values, but they did remember to disable multi jumps and vertical jumps. Jett's jump is wider than the gaps between platforms, so other than one very lucky incident I can never make those super-narrow platforms twice in a row. Falling to the bottom places you on the platform furthest down, but I realise that when you spawn for the first time you do so at the top, where you can see the end of the jump quest. Only way out is forfeiting the quest and spaceshipping back to Ellinia, picking the quest up again from Fanzy and spawning at the top.

Protip for anyone who feels like doing this: you can just click around where the minimap is showing the NPC for the end of the JQ and it will trigger the end of the quest even if you didn't reach it. What it WON'T do is remove you from the quest map.

Which has no exit portal either.

Return scrolls are disabled.

...back to the spaceship for my mandatory 1 hour wait I go.

"[Event Discussion] - Removal of 2x Stamp Weekend from Fairy Bros' Golden Giveaway **Hello Maplers!**

**1. Beginning** \- As many of people were wondering what happen to 2x stamps weekend and thought maybe its just an known issue and GMS Nexon will fix it soon or later. Well I'm here to bring the bad news that unfortunately 2x stamps weekend has been removed because KMS Nexon didn't want to change how much time it takes to get a reward.

**2. Middle** \- What does this mean now for future FBGG event(s). Days have been cutted down 9 to 7 days (once week check-ins). You (Maplers) now have to purchase golden passes in order to make up missed days depending how absent attendance(s) making this event sorta and kinda paywalled now. Event is now impossible to unavoid miss less than 14/15 days especially for those whom have jobs, activates, school, collages, overall busy livelihood schedule(s) or Health elements interfere such as sickness, illness, mental, physical etc. And while its just common sense to not worried or dont miss any days at all it doesn't cover over the fact the change was done out of typical incompetence from nexon. 

**3. Climax** \- How could this been all avoided. First Better Detail Explanation and Transparency (GMS Patch Notes) it would have spared people from assuming its a known bug issue instead of the poor or vague way to explain something from another region got change/removed so GMS Might or Not Get the change/removals. Second KMS Nexon should have cut down the 55 minutes to lesser minutes so its not such a dread to wait an hour to stamp or get a reward from Fairy Bros' Golden Giveaway and not remove 2x stamp weekend as right now from after the feedback thread (GMS) maplers are kinda tired of extended maintences + FBGG returns = Everyone misses first day now pay up 3,000k MPs/NXs.

**Conclusion** \- Lack of Transparency is starting to become a problem all over again. First Cube Revamp which we still have ZERO communication on the changes (rates%) current is mixed research information all could have been avoided if cubes weren't changed in the first place besides balance and better the rate chances% to tier up potentials on gears/weapons/emblems. Second Events even though this was a KMS Decision it didn't help much GMS the way they said it the patch notes sounds poor or vaguely explained without the actual reason details from KMS Nexon Decision explanation.

"I can't take it anymore, is it worth moving from reboot to reg servers? I play mostly reboot server but it has done nothing but bring me down as an individual. Everyday I get on reboot to do my arcane river dailies and it pisses me off. I just want to do the damn Lach dailies and I can't find a channel for Crooked Victory Plates.  

I just can’t take it any longer, Reboot is so abusive and toxic it’s crazy. I literally only need 200 mobs and the channels are so full. I thought the removal of the spawn enhancer wild totems would kill maplestory, but no one even realizes how disgustingly full reboot is right now.

Every single time I try to do my weekly Chaos Vellum, the server lag kills me because of how full Reboot is. I just can't take it anymore, if I had one of those breath of divinities I wouldn't be dying out every time. I saw the video of the first GMS clear of Kalos, and they have some of the strongest players in existence. They are able to tank the half screen attacks from Kalos. It’s fucking driving me insane how easy reg server is because they can just swipe and get a breath of divinity. 

I want to experience the same end game as reg server. Is it easy training past 250? I would expect it would be very easy to get maps in those Limina maps because of the server population being very low. I'll be happy knowing that I can do my lach dailies without cc'ing 12 times. Eventually I know I will hit a very high level of 260 and I heard monster park extreme gives ridiculous amount of experience. I can simply park my character at 260 and do dailies until I hit 275 and then probably do end game bosses once I get my breath of divinity.

In my experience when I launch the game, I am met with a ""Not Responding"" client for a few minutes before getting to the ""World Selection Page"" which is already laggy and stuttering. Eventually I get into the game where it stutters every few seconds. 

I have been troubleshooting the issue for the past few days thinking it was something to do with my local machine but I haven't been able to correct it. My PC can handle just about every comparable benchmark and game I've thrown at it.

The previous posts related to this topic implied that an undocumented fix during a subsequent maintenance resolved the issue but I was wondering if anyone had any further insights on the problem.",Maplestory

"PSA: You can get more Haste Boosters by doing all Haste Missions on multiple characters After doing all the Haste Missions on a single character you end up with 5 Boosters and 1 Super Booster. I have found that you are able to get an additional 5 Boosters if you do all of the Missions again on another character after hitting ""Claim All.""

Here is the important part though: do NOT claim the Haste rewards individually after each mission. Wait until you have all 6 missions completed and then hit the ""Claim All"" button to get the 5 Boosters. 

From what I've tested, hitting that ""Claim All"" button will give you a Booster for each mission you've cleared, minus one. Doesn't give you any extra Super Boosters or Hase Feathers. And you won't get any Boosters by claiming each missions individually. 

You're able to do this on as many characters as you're willing, though you're really only limited by time as doing all the missions takes like 30-40 minutes. Happy grinding!",Maplestory

"New Players Finding Guides and Asking Questions Me (Aran, lv218) and a friend (Lara, lv212) started GMS Reboot recently (when there was 2 days left on the lv250 burning event) and there are a ton of guides floating around but we have no idea what's good to follow or what's outdated. We're trying to find ways to progress without being carried (by other people at least). I was acquainted with MSEA a few years back but nothing like endgame tier (usually got carried) but my friend is completely new and GMS has been a new experience for us. 

So now there are a few things I wanted to ask the community:
- What and whose guides should we start off with?
- My friend is struggling to live as a lv212 Lara and couldn't do the Chu Chu Island storyline along with farming in any lv200+ areas. He already had around 700k+ range and enough arcane force to match the area but he still dies rather quickly. Any solutions other than switching mains?
- What's the least painful way to get epic potential scrolls?
- How do we know if we're ready for hard bosses like czak or cra or lomein?
- Is it worth it to go for lv 3 link skills or is lv140 enough on most characters?
- Is making a 2 person guild a good idea? (If yes, how should we level the guild?)
- Is there a way to get the blue PQ damage skin with just 2 people?
- What potentials should we focus on first?

"Questions about funded characters and level progression on Maple Story Hi guys,

I am a veteran player looking to come back to Maple Story, but I haven't played in forever and everything has changed. If you have a few minutes, I was hoping to learn how level progression and funding works on Maple Story right now. 

I will thank each person who helps me. I hope you guys don't facepalm at the 23 ""thank you"" notes. I just don't want to be a jerk and leave out somebody who spent time helping me. Please note that I made another thread a few days ago and some of you guys were ultra helpful, and I am very grateful for that. But I've been looking around videos, and honestly, information-wise, I am drowning trying to figure it out. So, I hope you guys don't mind if I make another thread. 

First, can characters be ported to other servers for a fee nowadays? In my day, that was possible, I think the price was 20,000 NX for a port and it was made effective during a server maintenance. The reason I ask is because I am not sure I want to stay in the server where my characters were placed after Khaini as a server ceased to exist.

Regarding funding, I do not want to touch that hacked meso crap and was hoping to know how legit funding works nowadays. I was told about the Reboot server, which is f2p, but I don't mind rewarding the game I have fun on, so I'll likely choose a conventional server. I was told that Maple Points can be exchanged for mesos. How many Maple Points would, realistically, fund a highly effective character? Back in the ""olden days,"" you could have a situation where a single godly sword cost literally 2000 dollars. Is this still the situation nowadays, expenses-wise? Or is gear more toned down price-wise? 

And, in terms of funding, are Maple Points the big thing? Or is the oldschool solution of using Gachapon Tickets on Gachapon machines and hoping for an ultra-rare item to sell on Free Market still the preferred way to go?

Regarding equipment modification/improvement, how does that work? Back in my day, we had scrolls of varying % of success and power if successful, as well as White Scrolls, which negated a failed scrolling attempt. From what I am seeing in Cash Shop, there seems to be a number of Cubes. I am completely failing to understand it.

Regarding NX clothes to make a character look nice, there were instances ages ago where permanent NX clothes could be bought instead of 90 day ones. That is, these NX clothes did not expire, they lasted forever. Is there any way to get such NX clothes today? Or was this a short-lived experiment that won't be repeated?

Regarding level progression, I have a lvl 200 Bishop and a lvl 100 White Knight, (Paladin 3rd job.) I want to play the Paladin because it's one of the less popular classes (so not everybody is playing it) but also seems to be a safe and stress-free pick due to its emphasis on defense while being useful in parties due to support skills. But I also want to play the Bishop because it's the one and only truly dedicated support. Can someone please recommend a recent and well-made guide to these two classes?

Thank you guys in advance for your help.",Maplestory

In the unlikely event that I've missed something, please fill in the gaps in the comments below.

# The Beginning

* A lady in a white robe and dope ass ribbons in her hair made an entire planet inspired by a leaf
* A dude in a black robe wasn't super chill with that idea, so he started destroying stuff
* A whole bunch of folks from the Maple world rallied together to seal him with a big ass crystal that would definitely last forever

# After the Beginning but not yet the Middle

* You choose your origin story (ex. a frozen hero, a forgotten hero, a suddenly-weak-again hero, a simp for an empress, a kid on a boat, a part of some sort of revolutionary group, idk lots more)
* Apparently you're the only one who can stop the dude in the black robe from destroying shit, so you go about training and exploring the world.
* Eventually senpai notices you can you get roped into cleaning up the world
* In the mean time the dude in the black robe went off an made some friends, so now you have to beat them up periodically and sometimes in a specific order
   * A dragon knight who's only personality is dropping shit form the sky
   * An insecure old woman who lives in a temple and then lives in a super depressing maze
   * A nerd who's super into spiders
   * An elf who is a little too good at sleeping
   * A giant ass lion in a castle
   * A wizard who is definitely not a snake
   * A man named after a flower
   * An edgelord that would rather do anything else than let you hit him
* At some point there's a creep in a cave that likes marionettes and you get a helmet that makes you look like an ass
* You travel through space and time to challenge its ruler and find that it is a pink marshmallow with a lot of attitude
* After that you help a dude who forgot who he is and are rewarded with some dope skills and have to go explore a magic river

# The Middle

* In the magic river you stumble across a a colorless wasteland and help a dude remember something again but what him fall off a bird and to fix that you fight a gummy worm
   * As a thank you, the dude turns into vapor and dips
   * You can also go help a dude publish his survival guide in an upside down subway tunnel before the sun explodes
* Eventually when you're bored you decide to jump off the fucking waterfall because why not, and vapor boy turns out is actually a flying fish
   * Apparently the fish is a real bro, and you shouldn't make jokes about it on reddit
* The fish drops you off at an island obsessed with making a sandwich for a rock bro who gets hungry after fighting a shark
   * You appropriate the local culture and dish up a culinary masterpiece which the rock bro loves and then lets you hop by
   * If you want you can take a de-tour to an island where everyone wears a button. Apparently when you die on the Maple world you get to come back as a button thing and continue your painful existence.
      * You stop it by killing a flower and a lion wearing a cape breaks a particular button with his cane which is apparently all it takes.
* The fish is back, and this time it drops you off in the wrong part of town and leaves it up to you to figure out how to get out
   * Everyone here is pretty shy about how they look, so they all wear masks but none of them dance
   * One dude is brave enough to talk to you and tells you the whole place is some kind of dream world which this elf lady made
   * He gets kidnapped, you save him, then you fight the elf lady
      * She's only got two personalities this time around, so you get shit on by a metric fuckton of purple rock not-bros that fall at the speed of light while also dodging an entire green ass dragon laser beam only to be teleported back into it because fuck you, before moving on to the second part
      * Here you bounce around waiting for the few frames you have to actually damage the boss in between all her bullshit. She can activate her cooties which kill you if she touches you, turns the entire map into a laser tag, and a shotgun of purple petals that seem to spawn whenever the fuck they want
   * After you beat her the mist clears and fish bro takes you to then next island that you need to fix
* Once you get to the magic tree island you realize its only inhabitants are these little spirit looking dudes who have unique personalities based on what they look like. One spirit is super lonely and sad and that makes the island die, until you save all the spirit friends and they make the lonely one feel better and you kill its personified bad feelings and save the day. 
* Somehow you end up chilling under the ocean with a bunch of robots before being let into the castle that isn't underwater but is still under the ocean. Here you help a a guy relive his memories of the girl he likes who got kidnapped by a snake wizard. She bites through a whole ass rock and blows some stuff up before you have to slog your way up some broken as road to stare and the snake wizard for a couple minutes until he ~~dies~~ retreats.
* You are rewarded by landing at some swampy spring place controlled by the nerd with the spider obsession. Apparently by this point you're on a mission to stop the black mage and you need to help some people with a beacon find some other people and to do that it involves fighting the spider nerd.
   * You can pop down into another totally different ocean, get swallowed by a spirit whale, and get a dope helmet out of the deal. 
* Apparently the beacon thing worked and you get picked up by a whole bunch of people probably more qualified to have done the things you've been doing up until this point. They have an air ship and now you have to spend an eternity here fighting shit so you can roll up to the giant floating testicle blocking your way to the black mage. 
* Once you beat the testicle you have to wind your way through a depressing maze and experience a metric fuck ton of negative self talk before fighting a red haired lady who is actually just super old and insecure about how she looks. 
* After the maze you end up in some sort of place invested with miniature god creatures. You do some shit here, and then have to face the last thing standing in your way before you can slap the black mage. 
   * Dunkle is a dude with a big ass sword who controls all those assholes who rolled up on you while training earlier and spawns them all over the place in the fight. Much like Magus, his only personality is dropping miss balls from the sky and watching you get yeeted across the map by some random spear spawn before you get hit in the knee by an arrow and alt-f4 until tomorrow.
* With dunkle defeated you can fight the black mage but not right away since that would be too easy. First you have to train for several hundred hours until your level is high enough for him to notice you.
   * Beat him once, and then for shits and giggles 9 more times to get some nice drip weapons (unless you use a dagger).

# The after The Middle

* Turns out there are a whole bunch of other planets and they're relevant again.
* Some how you arrive at this pretty dope looking citadel, but half the shadows are oriented the wrong way and there some sort of religious war going on I think.
* There are these angel warriors who are upset about something and one of them get a superiority complex and steals a sword and is now a baddie and now you have to go stop her. 
* At some point the entire place is set on fire, but you can travel back and forth between the on fire version and not-on fire version whenever you want so you probably don't have to stress about it too much. 
* I think it's pretty much the same story but now everything is on fire
* You get tired of being in the on-fire place, so you take a vacation and head to a local hotel in a desert where no one lives but they have train service.
* You help a dude fix his robot and some lady with ear muffs shows up drops a big reveal about something and then poofs. You are rewarded with a symbol that has a turtle on it because turtles are endemic to the desert.
* You notice a tower in the ocean next to the desert, climb to the top with a bunch of other randos you just met that has something to do with the earmuff lady. One of them is super into murals. At the top is a robot dog that wants to fite you, so you fite it.
* Eventually you get to a floating island made to look like the hills of China but they're actually machinery powering the floating island. Here you help some people do some stuff that results in a robot lady turning into some kind of mecha robot lady with lasers and stompy stompy attacks. The earmuff lady isn't impressed and dips.

"The haste event is grindy af? Dude, we have to kill 100k mobs in about 13 days(2/8-2/21). That amounts to almost 8k a day for the secret mission alone. Before we can start the secret mission, we have to fulfill the daily missions first, meaning another 2k mobs+ the elite bosses and the polio thing. That’s like 10k mobs a day? Wtf?

Am I missing something here or this is the grjndiest event so far this year? All that for a mediocre damage skin and pretty sweet train chair. Is it even worth?",Maplestory

"Anyone else think that the localization team missed the mark for Neo Tokyo? Fair warning, I'm a lore nerd. I read through all the dialogue for the Neo Tokyo story quests, but none of the other Zipangu quests. 

The way the translation team chose to write Asia and Dida not only felt out of character. 

Asia's VO depicts her as a formally spoken desperate yet serious Guardian, but the way she is written just feels like a slightly toned down Alicia (aka the Word Tree/Transcendent of Life) in that she addresses you so casually as a godly figure. 

Similarly, Dida's VO depicts him as a serious but noble-hearted child who speaks appropriately to his elders (remember that this is Japan), but again, addresses the Adversary, a stranger, in a casual and inappropriate way, duuuuuuuuuude. 

I didn't expect a 1:1 translation, but at least something faithful to the personalities depicted in the Japanese VO would have been nice. 

I will add that the way they wrote Ponicheleu and Garuda was quite good, at least.",Maplestory

"I was mad hyped for Neo Tokyo until... I found out that it's just another theme dungeon consisting of stages. This used to be my favorite place to train and mess around by FAR ever since it launched and I went there with all my characters back in Khaini. But now it's just a (japanese VA'd) dialogue simulator instead of the awesome place where u can train that it used to be.

I'm happy it's the original zones and music etc, but man, 10 minutes of dialogue and cutscenes for 50 seconds of killing 50 out of 50 mobs to do that again but in a different setting.

"(Haste Feather Shop) - Best Purchase Suggestions For my current character (Level 215 Corsair) - This is my tier-list of purchasing importance. I'll provide my reasoning, but I wanted to see if the community agreed that this is a good list with fair reasoning, or if I missed something or should consider a different order.

Nodestone &gt; Symbol Selector &gt; Honor Medal &gt; Rebirth Flame &gt; EXP Coupon\*

Nodestone since they are fairly cheap (30 feathers), and since I believe it will give my character the most value per-feather.

Symbols to progress through Arcane River Gates quicker. - Note I've seen the suggestions to push to lvl 220 and use symbols on Lachelein because of they are harder to get. So that is the current plan. (But I might buy others if I need a few to rank up here and there)

Honor medal and Rebirth Flames are both more RNG (and while good in their own regards) I -think- that since one roll of Inner Ability costs \~40 Feathers, and the Rebirth Flame only gives one piece of gear potential for good stats - for a fairly expensive price of minimum 25 feathers.

Finally EXP coupons - which I marked with \*, because I may buy a few here and there if I do a few daily-grind sessions. But they are lowest priority for me personally.

"250 Bright (Black) Cube tier-up results Small sample but I'm broke:

Cubes used at Unique tier: 249

Unique -&gt; Unique: 242

Percentage of tier-ups from Unique rank: 2.81%

This is a fair bit lower than the oft-cited community-found value of 4.8% (sample size \~5.8k), and a fair bit higher than KMS rates. To reiterate, this is a **very small sample size**. Ideally, people can post their own findings and we can generate a better idea of cube rates from it.

Tier-ups no longer gray out the ""One More Time!"" button. Instead, clicking on said button creates a pop-up warning you against doing so, but allows you to continue.

"Confused about my buccs damage Hello guys,

Just a question from someone who is a little confused.  So I am leveling up my buccs as a boss mule.  This will be my 5th one.  Something feels off in terms of my damage and I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong.  I have nearly 5k Legion but my damage seems rather low.  Also, while I was cubing my emblem today, (2b on those new black cubes and no tier up, that's a whole other story) I noticed something weird with the attk values. My initial line on my unique emblem was 6 all stat 9 str and and a trash line. My 2nd potential set was 9 percent attk and 9 percent str and a trash line yet it showed that this new line did nearly 10k less damage.  It felt like attk was contributing nothing to my damage.
